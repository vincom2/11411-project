* Take a bunch of sentences that could be potential questions from wikipedia articles. Manually classify them into the type of question they should become<br/>
  (Just do who, when, why, how, what, where)
* Now train a BAG OF WORDS NAIVE BAYES CLASSIFIER (WOOHOO) on these classified questions
* Now we can classify all sentences in any article given to us! woohoo! so we know what kinds of questions to generate!
