Initialization
==============
The ask program depends on Stanford CoreNLP and NER. Since presumably this program will be run over and over, to save on the
significant startup time of the two, they have to be run as servers in the background beforehand. Attempts were made to automate
this process, but due to the unreliability of the unix.andrew machines, it was decided that having this step done manually would be better.
STEPS:
1) change your working shell to bash (some of the scripts depend on this, I believe)
2) $ source /afs/andrew.cmu.edu/usr14/vincenth/public/11411/11411-project/setenv
3) $ screen -S coreNLP
   inside the screen session run
   $ ./invoke_corenlp
   (make sure this finishes loading and says serving!)
   then Ctrl+A D to detach.
4) $ screen -S NER
   inside the screen session run
   $ ./invoke_ner
   then Ctrl+A D to detach.

CAVEATS
=======
- You may have problems starting coreNLP. If that happens, maybe try a different unix.andrew server. Sorry, it's a memory hog.
- ask may be slow. Again, the bottleneck is coreNLP.
- Both ask and answer have some trouble with accented characters. I've tried fixing it with codecs.open utf-8 and stuff, but that just
  introduces other problems like question generation not working. I have no idea why. So they may crash on some files with accented
  characters. Sorry about that.
