 Aries is one of the constellations of the zodiac . It is located in the northern celestial hemisphere between Pisces to the west and Taurus to the east. The name Aries is Latin for ram , and its symbol is  ( Unicode ♈ ), representing a ram's horns. It is one of the 48 constellations described by the 2nd century astronomer Ptolemy , and remains one of the 88 modern constellations. It is a mid-sized constellation, ranking 39th overall size, with an area of 441 square degrees (1.1% of the celestial sphere ). 
 Although Aries came to represent specifically the ram whose fleece became the Golden Fleece of Ancient Greek mythology , it has represented a ram since late Babylonian times. Before that, the stars of Aries formed a farmhand. Different cultures have incorporated the stars of Aries into different constellations including twin inspectors in China and a porpoise in the Marshall Islands. Aries is a relatively dim constellation, possessing only four bright stars: Hamal (Alpha Arietis, second magnitude), Sheratan (Beta Arietis, third magnitude), Mesarthim (Gamma Arietis, fourth magnitude), and 41 Arietis (also fourth magnitude). The few deep-sky objects within the constellation are quite faint and include several pairs of interacting galaxies. Several meteor showers appear to radiate from Aries, including the Daytime Arietids and the Epsilon Arietids .

 History and mythology  
 Aries is now recognized as an official constellation, albeit as a specific region of the sky, by the International Astronomical Union . It was originally defined in ancient texts as a specific pattern of stars, and has remained a constellation since ancient times; it now includes the ancient pattern as well as the surrounding stars.  
 In ancient Egyptian astronomy , Aries was associated with the god Amon-Ra , who was depicted as a man with a ram's head and represented fertility and creativity. Because it was the location of the vernal equinox, it was called the "Indicator of the Reborn Sun".

 Aries was not fully accepted as a constellation until classical times.  
 Historically, Aries has been depicted as a crouched, wingless ram with its head turned towards Taurus. Ptolemy asserted in his Almagest that Hipparchus depicted Alpha Arietis as the ram's muzzle, though Ptolemy did not include it in his constellation figure. Instead, it was listed as an "unformed star", and denoted as "the star over the head". John Flamsteed , in his Atlas Coelestis , followed Ptolemy's description by mapping it above the figure's head.  
 The First Point of Aries , the location of the vernal equinox , is named for the constellation. This is because the Sun crossed the celestial equator from south to north in Aries more than two millennia ago. Hipparchus defined it in 130 BCE. as a point south of Gamma Arietis . Because of the precession of the equinoxes , the First Point of Aries has since moved into Pisces and will move into Aquarius by around 2600 CE. The Sun now appears in Aries from late April through mid May, though the constellation is still associated with the beginning of spring.  
 Medieval Muslim astronomers depicted Aries in various ways. Astronomers like al-Sufi saw the constellation as a ram, modeled on the precedent of Ptolemy. However, some Islamic celestial globes depicted Aries as a nondescript four-legged animal with what may be antlers instead of horns.  
 The obsolete constellations introduced in Aries ( Musca Borealis , Vespa , and Apis ) have all been composed of the northern stars.  
 In 1922, the International Astronomical Union defined its recommended three-letter abbreviation, "Ari".  
 In non-Western astronomy  
 In traditional Chinese astronomy , stars from Aries were used in several constellations. The brightest stars—Alpha, Beta, and Gamma Arietis—formed a constellation called Lou , variously translated as "bond", "lasso", and "sickle", which was associated with the ritual sacrifice of cattle. This name was shared by the 16th lunar mansion , the location of the full moon closest to the autumnal equinox . The lunar mansion represented the area where animals were gathered before sacrifice around that time.  
 In a similar system to the Chinese, the first lunar mansion in Hindu astronomy was called "Aswini", after the traditional names for Beta and Gamma Arietis, the Aswins . Because the Hindu new year began with the vernal equinox, the Rig Veda contains over 50 new-year's related hymns to the twins, making them some of the most prominent characters in the work. Aries itself was known as " Aja " and " Mesha ".

 Further information: List of stars in Aries 
 Aries has three prominent stars forming an asterism , designated Alpha, Beta, and Gamma Arietis by Johann Bayer . All three are commonly used for navigation.  
 β Arietis , also known as Sheratan, is a blue-white star with an apparent visual magnitude of 2.64. Its traditional name is derived from " sharatayn ", the Arabic word for "the two signs", referring to both Beta and Gamma Arietis in their position as heralds of the vernal equinox. The two stars were known to the Bedouin as " qarna al-hamal ", "horns of the ram".  
 γ Arietis , with a common name of Mesarthim, is a binary star with two white-hued components, located in a rich field of magnitude 8–12 stars. Its traditional name has conflicting derivations. It may be derived from a corruption of "al-sharatan", the Arabic word meaning "pair" or a word for "fat ram".  
 The constellation is home to several double stars, including Epsilon, Lambda, and Pi Arietis. ε Arietis is a binary star with two white components. The primary is of magnitude 5.2 and the secondary is of magnitude 5.5. The system is 290 light-years from Earth.  
 Most of the other stars in Aries visible to the naked eye have magnitudes between 3 and 5. δ Ari , called Boteïn, is a star of magnitude 4.35, 170 light-years away. It has an absolute magnitude of −0.1 and a spectral class of K2.  
 Aries has its share of variable stars, including R and U Arietis, Mira-type variable stars, and T Arietis, a semi-regular variable star. R Arietis is a Mira variable star that ranges in magnitude from a minimum of 13.7 to a maximum of 7.4 with a period of 186.8 days.  
 Deep-sky objects  
 The few deep-sky objects in Aries are very dim. Nevertheless, several scientifically interesting galaxies lie within its borders; it has spiral , elliptical , and interacting galaxies . 
 
 
 
  
NGC 772, with a notated supernova . 
 
 
 NGC 772 is a spiral galaxy with an integrated magnitude of 10.3, located southeast of β Arietis and 15 arcminutes west of 15 Arietis .  
 NGC 678 and NGC 680 are a pair of galaxies in Aries that are only about 200,000 light-years apart. Part of the NGC 691 group of galaxies, both are at a distance of approximately 130 million light-years. NGC 678 is an edge-on spiral galaxy that is 4.5 by 0.8 arcminutes. NGC 680, an elliptical galaxy with an asymmetrical boundary, is the brighter of the two at magnitude 12.9; NGC 678 has a magnitude of 13.35. Both galaxies have bright cores, but NGC 678 is the larger galaxy at a diameter of 171,000 light-years; NGC 680 has a diameter of 72,000 light-years. NGC 678 is further distinguished by its prominent dust lane . NGC 691 itself is a spiral galaxy slightly inclined to our line of sight. It has multiple spiral arms and a bright core. Because it is so diffuse, it has a low surface brightness. It has a diameter of 126,000 light-years and is 124 million light-years away.  
 NGC 821 is an E6 elliptical galaxy. It is unusual because it has hints of an early spiral structure, which is normally only found in lenticular and spiral galaxies. NGC 821 is 2.6 by 2.0 arcminutes and has a visual magnitude of 11.3. Its diameter is 61,000 light-years and it is 80 million light-years away.  
 Meteor showers  
 Aries is home to several meteor showers . The Daytime Arietid meteor shower is one of the strongest meteor showers that occurs during the day, lasting from 22 May to 2 June. It is an annual shower associated with the Marsden group of comets that peaks on 7 June with a maximum zenithal hourly rate of 54 meteors.  
 The Delta Arietids are another meteor shower radiating from Aries. Peaking on 9 December with a low peak rate, the shower lasts from 8 December to 14 January, with the highest rates visible from 8 to 14 December. The average Delta Aquarid meteor is very slow, with an average velocity of 13.2 kilometres (8.2&#160;mi) per second. However, this shower sometimes produces bright fireballs .  
 The Autumn Arietids also radiate from Aries. The shower lasts from 7 September to 27 October and peaks on 9 October. Its peak rate is low.  
 Planetary systems  
 Aries contains several stars with extrasolar planets . HIP 14810 , a G5 type star, is orbited by three giant planets (those more than ten times the mass of Earth ).  
 Astrology  
 Main article: Aries (astrology) 
 As of 2002  , the Sun resides in the constellation Aries from April 18 to May 13 as it moves through the ecliptic. In tropical astrology , the Sun is considered to be in the sign Aries from March 21 to April 20, and in sidereal astrology , from April 15 to May 15.
