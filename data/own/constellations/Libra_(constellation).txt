 The brightest stars in Libra form a quadrangle that distinguishes it for the unaided observer. Alpha Librae , called Zubenelgenubi, is a binary star divisible in binoculars, 77 light-years from Earth. The primary is a blue-white star of magnitude 2.7 and the secondary is a white star of magnitude 5.2. Its traditional name means "the southern claw". Zubeneschamali ( Beta Librae ) is the corresponding "northern claw" to Zubenelgenubi. The brightest star in Libra, it is a green-tinged star of magnitude 2.6, 160 light-years from Earth. Gamma Librae is called Zubenelakrab, which means "the scorpion's claw", completing the suite of names referring to Libra's archaic status. It is an orange giant of magnitude 3.9, 152 light-years from Earth.  
 Libra is home to several other binary and double stars. Iota Librae is a complex multiple star, 377 light-years from Earth, with both optical and true binary components. The primary appears as a blue-white star of magnitude 4.5; it is a binary star indivisible in even the largest amateur instruments with a period of 23 years. The secondary, visible in small telescopes as a star of magnitude 9.4, is a binary with two components, magnitudes 10 and 11. There is an optical companion to Iota Librae; 25 Librae is a star of magnitude 6.1, 219 light-years from Earth and visible in binoculars. Mu Librae is a binary star divisible in medium-aperture amateur telescopes, 235 light-years from Earth. The primary is of magnitude 5.7 and the secondary is of magnitude 6.8.  
 There are many variable stars in Libra as well. Delta Librae is an Algol-type eclipsing variable star, 304 lightyears from Earth. It has a period of 2 days, 8 hours; its minimum magnitude of 5.9 and its maximum magnitude is 4.9. FX Librae , designated 48 Librae , is a shell star of magnitude 4.9. Shell stars, like Pleione and Gamma Cassiopeiae , are blue supergiants with irregular variations caused by their abnormally high speed of rotation. This ejects gas from the star's equator.  
 σ Librae was formerly known as γ Scorpii despite being well inside the boundaries of Libra. It was not redesignated as σ Librae until 1851 (by Benjamin A. Gould ). 
 Deep-sky objects  
 Libra is home to one bright globular cluster , NGC 5897 . It is a loose cluster, 40,000 light-years from Earth; it is fairly large and has an integrated magnitude of 9.  
 Planetary systems  
 Libra is home to the star Gliese 581 , which has a planetary system consisting of at least 6 planets. Both Gliese 581 d , and Gliese 581 g are debatably the most promising candidates for life, although Gliese 581 g's existences has been disputed and has not been entirely confirmed or agreed on in the scientific community.  
 The family of candidate habitable planets was extended in late September 2010 to include exoplanets around red dwarf stars because of Gliese 581 g, which is a tidally locked planet in the middle of the habitable zone . Weather studies show that tidally locked planets may still have the ability to support life.  
 History and mythology  
 
 
 
  
Libra as depicted in Urania's Mirror , a set of constellation cards published in London c.1825 
 
 
 Libra was known in Babylonian astronomy as MUL Zibanu (the "scales" or "balance"), or alternatively as the Claws of the Scorpion. The scales were held sacred to the sun god Shamash , who was also the patron of truth and justice.  
 Libra is a constellation not mentioned by Eudoxus or Aratus .  
 Libra is the only zodiac sign that does not symbolize a living creature. 
 Astrology  
 Main article: Libra (astrology) 
 As of 2002  , the Sun appears in the constellation Libra from October 31 to November 22. In tropical astrology , the Sun is considered to be in the sign Libra from September 23 to October 22, and in sidereal astrology , from October 16 to November 15. 
 Visualizations  
 Traditionally, α and β Librae are considered to represent the scales' balance beam, and γ and σ are the weighing pans. 
 H.A. Rey has suggested a way to connect the stars more fully to graphically show a balance . Beta Librae represents the top of the balance, Gamma Librae and Alpha Librae represent the balance beam. Upsilon Librae and Tau Librae represent the left plate of the balance, while Sigma Librae represents the right plate. All these stars are of the third magnitude. 
 Namesakes  
 USS Libra (AKA-12) was a United States navy ship named after the constellation.
