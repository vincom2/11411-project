 Taurus is one of the constellations of the zodiac , which means it is crossed by the plane of the ecliptic . Its name is a Latin word meaning " bull ", and its astrological symbol is a stylized bull's head:  ( Unicode ♉ ). Taurus is a large and prominent constellation in the northern hemisphere 's winter sky. It is one of the oldest constellations, dating back to at least the Early Bronze Age when it marked the location of the Sun during the spring equinox . Taurus came to symbolize the bull in the mythologies of Ancient Babylon , Egypt and Greece . 
 There are a number of features of interest to astronomers. Taurus hosts two of the nearest open clusters to Earth, the Pleiades and the Hyades , both of which are visible to the naked eye. At first magnitude, the red giant Aldebaran is the brightest star in the constellation. In the northwest part of Taurus is the supernova remnant Messier 1 , more commonly known as the Crab Nebula. One of the closest regions of active star formation, the Taurus-Auriga complex, crosses into the northern part of the constellation. The variable star T Tauri is the prototype of a class of pre-main-sequence stars .

 Characteristics  
 Taurus is a large and prominent constellation in the northern hemisphere 's winter sky, between Aries to the west and Gemini to the east; to the north lie Perseus and Auriga , to the southeast Orion , to the south Eridanus , and to the southwest Cetus . In September and October, Taurus is visible in the evening along the eastern horizon. The most favorable time to observe Taurus in the night sky is during the months of December and January. By March and April, the constellation will appear to the west during the evening twilight.  
 This constellation forms part of the zodiac, and hence is intersected by the ecliptic . This circle across the celestial sphere forms the apparent path of the Sun as the Earth completes its annual orbit. As the orbital plane of the Moon and the planets lie near the ecliptic, they can usually be found in the constellation Taurus during some part of each year.  
 The recommended three-letter abbreviation for the constellation, as adopted by the International Astronomical Union in 1922, is "Tau".  
 Notable features  
 
 
 
  
The constellation Taurus as it can be seen by the naked eye.  The constellation lines have been added for clarity. 
 
 
 During November, the Taurid meteor shower appears to radiate from the general direction of this constellation. The Beta Taurid meteor shower occurs during the months of June and July in the daytime, and is normally observed using radio techniques.  
 The brightest member of this constellation is Aldebaran , an orange-hued, spectral class K5&#160;III giant star .  
 In the northeastern quadrant of the Taurus constellation lie the Pleiades (M45), one of the best known open clusters, easily visible to the naked eye. The seven most prominent stars in this cluster are at least visual magnitude six, and so the cluster is also named the "Seven Sisters". However, many more stars are visible with even a modest telescope.  
 In the northern part of the constellation to the northwest of the Pleiades lies the Crystal Ball Nebula, known by its catalogue designation of NGC 1514 . This planetary nebula is of historical interest following its discovery by German-born English astronomer William Herschel in 1790. Prior to that time, astronomers had assumed that nebulae were simply unresolved groups of stars. However, Herschel could clearly resolve a star at the center of the nebula that was surrounded by a nebulous cloud of some type. In 1864, English astronomer William Huggins used the spectrum of this nebula to deduce that the nebula is a luminous gas, rather than stars.  
 To the west, the two horns of the bull are formed by Beta (β) Tauri and Zeta (ζ) Tauri ; two star systems that are separated by 8°. Beta is a white, spectral class B7 III giant star known as El Nath , which comes from the Arabic phrase "the butting", as in butting by the horns of the bull.

 supernova remnant (M1) 
 
 
 A degree to the northwest of ζ Tauri is the Crab Nebula ( M1 ), a supernova remnant . This expanding nebula was created by a Type II supernova explosion, which was seen from Earth on July 4, 1054. It was bright enough to be observed during the day, and is mentioned in Chinese historical texts. At its peak the supernova reached magnitude −4, but the nebula is currently magnitude 8.4 and requires a telescope to observe.  
 The star Lambda (λ) Tauri is an eclipsing binary star. This system consists of a spectral class B3 star being orbited by a less massive class A4 star. The plane of their orbit lies almost along the line of sight to the Earth. Every 3.953 days the system temporarily decreases in brightness by 1.1 magnitudes as the brighter star is partially eclipsed by the dimmer companion. The two stars are separated by only 0.1 astronomical units , so their shapes are modified by mutual tidal interaction. This results in a variation of their net magnitude throughout each orbit.  
 Located about 1.8° west of Epsilon (ε) Tauri is T Tauri , the prototype of a class of variable stars called T Tauri stars . This star undergoes erratic changes in luminosity, varying between magnitude 9 to 13 over a period of weeks or months.  
 This constellation includes part of the Taurus-Auriga complex, or Taurus dark clouds, a star forming region of sparse, filamentary clouds. This spans a diameter of 98 light-years (30 parsecs ) and contains 35,000&#160; solar masses of material, which is both larger and less massive than the Orion Nebula .

 The identification of the constellation of Taurus with a bull is very old, certainly dating to the Chalcolithic , and perhaps even to the Upper Paleolithic . Michael Rappenglück of the University of Munich believes that Taurus is represented in a cave painting at the Hall of the Bulls in the caves at Lascaux (dated to roughly 15,000 BC), which he believes is accompanied by a depiction of the Pleiades.  
 Taurus marked the point of vernal (spring) equinox in the Chalcolithic and the Early Bronze Age (the " Age of Taurus "), from about 4000 BC to 1700 BC, after which it moved into the neighboring constellation Aries .  
 In the Mesopotamian Epic of Gilgamesh , one of the earliest works of literature , the goddess Ishtar sends Taurus, the Bull of Heaven, to kill Gilgamesh for spurning her advances.  
 The same iconic representation of the Heavenly Bull was depicted in the Dendera zodiac , an Egyptian bas-relief carving in a ceiling that depicted the celestial hemisphere using a planisphere . In these ancient cultures, the orientation of the horns was portrayed as upward or backward. This differed from the later Greek depiction where the horns pointed forward.  
 In Greek mythology , Taurus was identified with Zeus , who assumed the form of a magnificent white bull to abduct Europa , a legendary Phoenician princess. In illustrations of Greek mythology, only the front portion of this constellation are depicted; this was sometimes explained as Taurus being partly submerged as he carried Europa out to sea. A second Greek myth portrays Taurus as Io , a mistress of Zeus. To hide his lover from his wife Hera , Zeus changed Io into the form of a heifer.  
 Taurus became an important object of worship among the Druids . Their Tauric religious festival was held while the Sun passed through the constellation.

 Space exploration  
 The Space probe Pioneer 10 is moving in the direction of this constellation, though it will not be nearing any of the stars in this constellation for many thousands of years, by which time its batteries will be long dead.
