 History and mythology  
 Aquarius is identified as GU.LA "The Great One" in the Babylonian star catalogues and represents the god Ea himself, who is commonly depicted holding an overflowing vase. The Babylonian star-figure appears on entitlement stones and cylinder seals from the second millennium. It contained the winter solstice in the Early Bronze Age.  
 In the Greek tradition, the constellation became represented as simply a single vase from which a stream poured down to Piscis Austrinus . The name in the Hindu zodiac is likewise kumbha "water-pitcher", showing that the zodiac reached India via Greek intermediaries.  
 In Greek mythology, Aquarius is sometimes associated with Deucalion , the son of Prometheus who built a ship with his wife Pyrrha to survive an imminent flood. They sailed for nine days before washing ashore on Mount Parnassus .  
 In non-Western astronomy  
 In Chinese astronomy , the stream of water flowing from the Water Jar was depicted as the "Army of Yu-Lin" ( Yu-lin-kiun or Yulinjun ). The name "Yu-lin" means "feathers and forests", referring to the numerous light-footed soldiers from the northern reaches of the empire represented by these faint stars.  
 Near the border with Cetus , the axe Fuyue was represented by three stars; its position is disputed and may have instead been located in Sculptor . Tienliecheng also has a disputed position; the 13-star castle replete with ramparts may have possessed Nu and Xi Aquarii but may instead have been located south in Piscis Austrinus. The Water Jar asterism was seen to the ancient Chinese as the tomb, Fenmu . Nearby, the emperors' mausoleum Xiuliang stood, demarcated by Kappa Aquarii and three other collinear stars. Ku ("crying") and Qi ("weeping"), each composed of two stars, were located in the same region.  
 Three of the Chinese lunar mansions shared their name with constellations. Nu , also the name for the 10th lunar mansion, was a handmaiden represented by Epsilon, Mu, 3, and 4 Aquarii. The 11th lunar mansion shared its name with the constellation Xu ("emptiness"), formed by Beta Aquarii and Alpha Equulei; it represented a bleak place associated with death and funerals. Wei , the rooftop and 12th lunar mansion, was a V-shaped constellation formed by Alpha Aquarii, Theta Pegasi, and Epsilon Pegasi; it shared its name with two other Chinese constellations, in modern-day Scorpius and Aries .  
 Depictions  
 
 
 
  
A representation of Aquarius printed in 1825 as part of Urania's Mirror , (including a now-obsolete constellation, Ballon Aerostatique south of it). 
 
 
 In the first century CE, Ptolemy 's Almagest established the common Western depiction of Aquarius. His water jar, an asterism itself, consists of Gamma, Pi, Eta, and Zeta Aquarii ; it pours water in a stream of more than 20 stars terminating with Fomalhaut , now assigned solely to Piscis Austrinus . The water bearer's head is represented by 5th magnitude 25 Aquarii while his left shoulder is Beta Aquarii ; his right shoulder and forearm are represented by Alpha and Gamma Aquarii respectively.

 Stars  
 Despite both its prominent position on the zodiac and its large size, Aquarius has no particularly bright stars, with its 4 brightest stars less than magnitude 2.  However, recent research has shown that there are several stars lying within its borders that possess planetary systems . 
 α Aquarii , also known as Sadalmelik , is a G2 spectral class star  
 β Aquarii , sometimes called Sadalsuud , is a G0 spectral class star  
 γ Aquarii , also called Sadachbia , is a blue-white  
 δ Aquarii , also known as Scheat  
 ε Aquarii , also known as Albali ,  
 ζ Aquarii is an F2 spectral class double star ; both stars are white.  
 θ Aquarii , sometimes called Ancha ,  
 λ Aquarii , also called Hudoor or Ekchusis ,  
 ξ Aquarii , also called Bunda , is an A7 spectral class star with an apparent magnitude of 4.69 and an absolute magnitude of 2.4.  
 π Aquarii , also called Seat , is a B0 spectral class star with an apparent magnitude of 4.66 and an absolute magnitude of -4.1.  
 Planetary systems  
 Eleven exoplanet systems have been found in Aquarius as of 2013. Gliese 876 , one of the nearest stars to Earth at a distance of 15 light-years,  
 There are also less-prominent systems in Aquarius. WASP-6 , a type G8 star of magnitude 12.4, is host to one exoplanet, WASP-6 b . The star is 307 parsecs from Earth and has a mass of 0.888 solar masses and a radius of 0.87 solar radii . WASP-6 b was discovered in 2008 by the transit method . It orbits its parent star every 3.36 days at a distance of 0.042 astronomical units (AU). It is 0.503 Jupiter masses but has a proportionally larger radius of 1.224 Jupiter radii .  
 There are several more single-planet systems in Aquarius. HD 210277 , a magnitude 6.63 yellow star located 21.29 parsecs from Earth, is host to one known planet: HD 210277 b . The 1.23 Jupiter mass planet orbits at nearly the same distance as Earth orbits the Sun - 1.1 AU, though its orbital period is significantly longer at around 442 days. HD 210277 b was discovered earlier than most of the other planets in Aquarius, detected by the radial velocity method in 1998. The star it orbits resembles the Sun beyond their similar spectral class ; it has a radius of 1.1 solar radii and a mass of 1.09 solar masses.  
 As of 2013, there are only two multiple-planet systems within the bounds of Aquarius: the Gliese 876 and HD 215152 systems. The former is quite prominent; the latter has only two planets and has a host star farther away at 21.5 parsecs. The HD 215152 system consists of the planets HD 215152 b and HD 215152 c orbiting their K0-type, magnitude 8.13 sun. Both discovered in 2011 by the radial velocity method, the two tiny planets orbit very close to their host star. HD 215152 c is the larger at 0.0097 Jupiter masses (still significantly larger than the Earth, which weighs in at 0.00315 Jupiter masses); its smaller sibling is barely smaller at 0.0087 Jupiter masses. The error in the mass measurements (0.0032 and 0.0049 M J respectively) is large enough to make this discrepancy statistically insignificant. HD 215152 c also orbits further from the star than HD 215152 b, 0.0852 AU compared to 0.0652.  
 Deep sky objects  
 
 
 
  
The green bean galaxy J2240 lies in the constellation of Aquarius.  
 
 
 Because of its position away from the galactic plane, the majority of deep-sky objects in Aquarius are galaxies, globular clusters, and planetary nebulae.  Aquarius contains three deep sky objects that are in the Messier catalog : the globular clusters Messier&#160;2 , Messier&#160;72 , and the open cluster Messier&#160;73 . Two well-known planetary nebulae are also located in Aquarius: the Saturn Nebula (NGC&#160;7009), to the eastwest of μ Aquarii ; and the famous Helix Nebula (NGC&#160;7293), southwest of δ&#160;Aquarii . 
 M2, also catalogued as NGC 7089, is an incredibly rich globular cluster located approximately 37,000 light-years from Earth. At magnitude 6.5, it is viewable in small- aperture instruments, but a 100&#160;mm aperture telescope is needed to resolve any stars. M72, also catalogued as NGC 6981, is a small 9 th magnitude globular cluster located approximately 56,000 light-years from Earth.  M73, also catalogued as NGC 6994, is an open cluster with highly disputed status. 
 Aquarius is also home to several planetary nebulae. NGC 6781 is a planetary nebula with a magnitude of 11.0, 2500 light-years from Earth. It appears as a near-perfect ring in a rich star field; the field is so rich that several stars appear superimposed on the nebula. Like the Ring Nebula in Lyra, the ring is approximately 1 light-year in diameter.  
 One galaxy visible in Aquarius is NGC 7727 , also of interest for amateur astronomers who wish to discover or observe supernovae . A spiral galaxy ( type S ), it has an integrated magnitude of 10.7 and is 3 by 3 arcseconds.  
 Meteor showers  
 There are three major meteor showers with radiants in Aquarius: the Eta Aquariids , the Delta Aquariids , and the Iota Aquariids. 
 The Eta Aquariids are the strongest meteor shower radiating from Aquarius. It peaks between 5 and 6 May with a rate of approximately 35 meteors per hour.  
 The Delta Aquariids is a double radiant meteor shower that peaks first on 29 July and second on 6 August. The first radiant is located in the south of the constellation, while the second radiant is located in the northern circlet of Pisces asterism. The southern radiant's peak rate is about 20 meteors per hour, while the northern radiant's peak rate is about 10 meteors per hour.  
 The Iota Aquariids is a fairly weak meteor shower that peaks on 6 August, with a rate of approximately 8 meteors per hour.  
 Astrology  
 Main article: Aquarius (astrology) 
 As of 2002  , the Sun appears in the constellation Aquarius from 16 February to 11 March. In tropical astrology , the Sun is considered to be in the sign Aquarius from 20 January to 19 February, and in sidereal astrology , from 15 February to 14 March. 
 Aquarius is also associated with the Age of Aquarius , a concept popular in 1960s counterculture . Despite this prominence, the Age of Aquarius will not dawn until the year 2597, as an astrological age does not begin until the Sun is in a particular constellation on the vernal equinox .
