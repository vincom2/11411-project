 Sagittarius&#160; is one of the constellations of the zodiac . It is one of the 48&#160;constellations&#160;listed by the 2nd-century astronomer&#160; Ptolemy &#160;and remains one of the&#160; 88 modern constellations . Its name is Latin for the archer , and its symbol is  ( Unicode U+2650 ♐), a stylized arrow. Sagittarius is commonly represented as a centaur drawing a bow. It lies between Scorpius and Ophiuchus to the west and Capricornus to the east.

The "Teapot" asterism is in Sagittarius. The Milky Way is the "steam" coming from the spout. 
 
 
 As seen from the northern hemisphere, the constellation's brighter stars form an easily recognizable asterism known as 'the Teapot '. The stars δ Sgr (Kaus Media), ε Sgr (Kaus Australis), ζ Sgr (Ascella), and φ Sgr form the body of the pot; λ Sgr (Kaus Borealis) is the point of the lid; γ 2 Sgr (Alnasl) is the tip of the spout; and σ Sgr (Nunki) and τ Sgr the handle.  
 Marking the bottom of the teapot's "handle" (or the shoulder area of the archer, are the bright star (2.59 magnitude) Zeta Sagittarii (ζ Sgr), named Ascella , and the fainter Tau Sagittarii (τ Sgr). 
 To complete the teapot metaphor, under good conditions, a particularly dense area of the Milky Way can be seen rising in a north-westerly arc above the spout, like a puff of steam rising from a boiling kettle.  
 The constellation as a whole is often depicted as having the rough appearance of a stick-figure archer drawing its bow, with the fainter stars providing the outline of the horse's body. Sagittarius famously points its arrow at the heart of Scorpius , represented by the reddish star Antares , as the two constellations race around the sky. Following the direct line formed by Delta Sagittarii (δ Sgr) and Gamma Sagittarii (γ Sgr) leads nearly directly to Antares. 
 Fittingly, Gamma Sagittarii is named Alnasl , the Arabic word for "arrowhead," and Delta Sagittarii is called Kaus Media , the "center of the bow," from which the arrow protrudes. Kaus Media bisects Lambda Sagittarii (λ Sgr) and Epsilon Sagittarii (ε Sgr), whose names Kaus Borealis and Kaus Australis refer to the northern and southern portions of the bow, respectively.

The constellation Sagittarius as it can be seen with the naked eye. 
 
 
 α Sgr (Rukbat, meaning "the archer's knee",  
 Sigma Sagittarii (σ Sgr) ("Nunki") is the constellation's second-brightest star at magnitude 2.08. Nunki is a B2V star approximately 260 light years away.  
 Zeta Sagittarii (ζ Sgr) ("Ascella"), with apparent magnitude 2.61 of A2 spectra, is actually a double star whose two components have magnitudes 3.3 and 3.5.  
 Delta Sagittarii (δ Sgr) ("Kaus Maridionalis"), is a K2 spectra star with magnitude 2.71 and only 85 light years from Earth.  
 Eta Sagittarii (η Sgr) is a double star with component magnitudes of 3.18 and 10, while Pi Sagittarii (π Sgr) is actually a triple system whose components have magnitudes 3.7, 3.8, and 6.0.  
 The Bayer designation Beta Sagittarii (Beta Sgr, β Sagittarii, β Sgr) is shared by two star systems, β¹ Sagittarii, with apparent magnitude 3.96, and β² Sagittarii, magnitude 7.4. The two stars are separated by 0.36° in the sky and are 378 light years from earth. Beta Sagittarii, located at a position associated with the forelegs of the centaur, has the traditional name Arkab , meaning "achilles tendon." 
 Deep-sky objects  
 
 
 
  
The Omega Nebula, also known as the Horseshoe or Swan Nebula. 
 
 
 The Milky Way is at its densest near Sagittarius, as this is where the galactic center lies. Consequently, Sagittarius contains many star clusters and nebulae . 
 Nebulae  
 Sagittarius contains several well-known nebulae, including the Lagoon Nebula (Messier 8), near λ Sagittarii; the Omega Nebula (Messier 17), also known as the Horseshoe Nebula or Swan Nebula, near the border with Scutum ; and the Trifid Nebula (Messier 20), a large nebula containing some very young, hot stars. 
 
 The Lagoon Nebula (M8) is an emission nebula that is located 5,000 light-years from Earth and measures 140 light-years by 60 light-years ( 1.5° ). Though it appears grey in telescopes to the unaided eye, long-exposure photographs reveal its pink hue, common to emission nebulae.  
 
 
 The Omega Nebula is a fairly bright nebula; it has an integrated magnitude of 6.0 and is 4890 light-years from Earth. It was discovered in 1746 by Philippe Loys de Chésaux ; observers since him have differed greatly in how they view the nebula, hence its myriad of names. Most often viewed as a checkmark, it was seen as a swan by George F. Chambers in 1889, a loon by Roy Bishop , and as a curl of smoke by Camille Flammarion .  
 
 
 The Trifid Nebula (M20, NGC 6514) is an emission nebula in Sagittarius that lies less than two degrees from the Lagoon Nebula. Discovered by French comet-hunter Charles Messier , it is located between 2,000 and 9,000 light-years from Earth and has a diameter of approximately 50 light-years. The outside of the Trifid Nebula is a bluish reflection nebula ; the interior is pink with two dark bands that divide it into three areas, sometimes called "lobes". Hydrogen in the nebula is ionized, creating its characteristic color, by a central triple star, which formed in the intersection of the two dark bands.  
 
 
 NGC 6559 is a star forming region located at a distance of about 5000 light-years from Earth, in the constellation of Sagittarius, showing both emission (red) and reflection (bluish) regions. 
 
 The grouping of the Lagoon Nebula, the Trifid Nebula, and NGC 6559 is often called the Sagittarius triplet . 
 In addition, several other nebulae have been located within Sagittarius and are of interest to astronomers. 
 
 M24 , also called the Small Sagittarius Star Cloud, is a star cluster with an approximate magnitude of 3. About 9400 light-years away, it has a diameter of approximately 330 light-years. Embedded in M24 is NGC 6603 , a smaller star cluster that is very dense. NGC 6567 , a dim planetary nebula , and Barnard 92 , a Bok globule , are also nearby.  
 
 
 NGC 6445 is a planetary nebula with an approximate magnitude of 11. A large nebula at over one arcminute in diameter, it appears very close to the globular cluster NGC 6440 .  
 
 
 NGC 6638 is a dimmer globular at magnitude 9.2, though it is more distant than M71 at a distance of 26,000 light-years. It is a Shapley class VI cluster; the classification means that it has intermediate concentration at its core. It is approximately a degree away from the brighter globulars M22 and M28 ; NGC 6638 is southeast and southwest of the clusters respectively.  
 
 
 
 
  
 Messier 54 was the first globular cluster found that is outside the Milky Way.  
 
 
 Other Deep Sky Objects  
 In 1999 a violent outburst at V4641 Sgr was thought to have revealed the location of the closest known black hole to Earth,  The Sagittarius Dwarf Elliptical Galaxy is located just outside the Milky Way . 
 Baade's Window is an area with very little obscuring dust that shows objects closer to the Milky Way's center than would normally be visible. NGC 6522 , magnitude 8.6, and NGC 6528 , magnitude 9.5, are both globular clusters visible through Baade's Window. 20,000 and 24,000 light-years from Earth, with Shapley classes of VI and V respectively, both are moderately concentrated at their cores. NGC 6528 is closer to the galactic core at an approximate distance of 2,000 light-years.  
 Mythology  
 
 
 
  
Sagittarius as depicted in Urania's Mirror , a set of constellation cards published in London c.1825. 
 
 
 The Babylonians identified Sagittarius as the god Nergal , a strange centaur-like creature firing an arrow from a bow.  The figure is reminiscent of modern depictions of Sagittarius. 
 In Greek mythology , Sagittarius is usually identified as a centaur : half human, half horse. However, perhaps due to the Greek's adoption of the Sumerian constellation, some confusion surrounds the identity of the archer.  
 A competing mythological tradition, as espoused by Eratosthenes , identified the Archer not as a centaur but as the satyr Crotus , son of Pan , who Greeks credited with the invention of archery.  
 The arrow of this constellation points towards the star Antares , the "heart of the scorpion," and Sagittarius stands poised to attack should Scorpius ever attack the nearby Hercules , or to avenge Scorpius's slaying of Orion .  
 Astrology  
 Main article: Sagittarius (astrology) 
 As of 2002  , the Sun appears in the constellation Sagittarius from 18 December to 18 January. In tropical astrology , the Sun is considered to be in the sign Sagittarius from 22 November to 21 December, and in sidereal astrology , from 16 December to 14 January. 
 
 Space Exploration  
 The Space probe New Horizons is moving in the direction of this constellation, though it will not be nearing any of the stars in this constellation for many thousands of years, by which time its radioisotope thermoelectric generator will have exhausted itself.
