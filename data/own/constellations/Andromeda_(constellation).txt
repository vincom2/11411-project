 Andromeda is one of the 48 constellations listed by the 2nd-century Greco-Roman astronomer Ptolemy and remains one of the 88 modern constellations . Located north of the celestial equator , it is named for Andromeda, daughter of Cassiopeia , in the Greek myth , who was chained to a rock to be eaten by the sea monster Cetus . Andromeda is most prominent during autumn evenings in the Northern Hemisphere , along with several other constellations named for characters in the Perseus myth. Because of its northern declination , Andromeda is only visible north of 40° south latitude; for observers farther south it lies below the horizon. It is one of the largest constellations, with an area of 722 square degrees . This is over 1,400 times the size of the full moon , 55% of the size of the largest constellation, Hydra , and over 10 times the size of the smallest constellation, Crux . 
 Its brightest star, Alpha Andromedae , is a binary star that has also been counted as a part of Pegasus , while Gamma Andromedae is a colorful binary and a popular target for amateur astronomers. Only marginally dimmer than Alpha, Beta Andromedae is a red giant, its color visible to the naked eye. The constellation's most obvious deep-sky object is the naked-eye Andromeda Galaxy (M31, also called the Great Galaxy of Andromeda), the closest spiral galaxy to the Milky Way and one of the brightest Messier objects . Several fainter galaxies, including M31's companions M110 and M32 , as well as the more distant NGC 891 , lie within Andromeda. The Blue Snowball Nebula , a planetary nebula , is visible in a telescope as a blue circular object. 
 In Chinese astronomy , the stars that make up Andromeda were members of four different constellations that had astrological and mythological significance; a constellation related to Andromeda also exists in Hindu mythology. Andromeda is the location of the radiant for the Andromedids , a weak meteor shower that occurs in November.

 Johannes Hevelius 's depiction of Andromeda, from the 1690 edition of his Uranographia . As was conventional for celestial atlases of the time, the constellation is a mirror image of modern maps as it was drawn from a perspective outside the celestial sphere .

 The uranography of Andromeda has its roots most firmly in the Greek tradition, though a female figure in Andromeda's location had appeared earlier in Babylonian astronomy . The stars that make up Pisces and the middle portion of modern Andromeda formed a constellation representing a fertility goddess , sometimes named as Anunitum or the Lady of the Heavens.  
 Andromeda is known as "the Chained Lady" or "the Chained Woman" in English. It was known as Mulier Catenata ("chained woman") in Latin and al-Mar'at al Musalsalah in Arabic .  It is connected with the constellation the pegasus 
 Andromeda was one of the original 48 constellations formulated by Ptolemy in his 2nd-century Almagest , in which it was defined as a specific pattern of stars. She is typically depicted with α Andromedae as her head, ο and λ Andromedae as her chains, and δ, π, μ, Β, and γ Andromedae representing her body and legs. However, there is no universal depiction of Andromeda and the stars used to represent her body, head, and chains.

 In traditional Chinese astronomy , nine stars from Andromeda (including Beta Andromedae, Mu Andromedae, and Nu Andromedae), along with seven stars from Pisces, formed an elliptical constellation called " Legs " (奎宿). This constellation either represented the foot of a walking person or a wild boar.  
 An Arab constellation called "al-Hut" (the fish) was composed of several stars in Andromeda, M31, and several stars in Pisces. ν And , μ And , β And , η And , ζ And , ε And , δ And , π And , and 32 And were all included from Andromeda; ν Psc , φ Psc , χ Psc , and ψ Psc were included from Pisces.  
 Hindu legends surrounding Andromeda are similar to the Greek myths. Ancient Sanskrit texts depict Antarmada chained to a rock, as in the Greek myth. Scholars believe that the Hindu and Greek astrological myths were closely linked; one piece of evidence cited is the similarity between the names "Antarmada" and "Andromeda".  
 Andromeda is also associated with the Mesopotamian creation story of Tiamat , the goddess of Chaos. She bore many demons for her husband, Apsu , but eventually decided to destroy them in a war that ended when Marduk killed her. He used her body to create the constellations as markers of time for humans.  
 In the Marshall Islands , Andromeda, Cassiopeia, Triangulum, and Aries are incorporated into a constellation representing a porpoise . Andromeda's bright stars are mostly in the body of the porpoise; Cassiopeia represents its tail and Aries its head.

 α And (Alpheratz, Sirrah) is the brightest star in this constellation. It is an A0p class  
 β And (Mirach) is a red-hued giant star of type M0  
 γ And (Almach) is an orange-hued bright giant star of type K3  
 δ And is an orange-hued giant star of type K3  
 ι And , κ , λ , ο , and ψ And form an asterism known as "Frederick's Glory", a name derived from a former constellation ( Frederici Honores ).  
 μ And is a white-hued main-sequence star of type A5 and magnitude 3.9.  
 υ And is a magnitude 4.1  
 ξ And (Adhil) is a binary star 217 light years away. The primary is an orange-hued giant star of type K0.  
 π And is a blue-white hued binary star of magnitude 4.3  
 51 And was reassigned by Johann Bayer to neighbouring Perseus, where he designated it "Upsilon Persei (υ Per)", but it was returned to Andromeda by the International Astronomical Union.  
 54 And was a former designation for φ Per .  
 56 And is an optical binary star. The primary is a yellow-hued giant star of type K0 with an apparent magnitude of 5.7  
 R And is a Mira-type variable star with a period of 409 days. Its maximum magnitude is 5.8 and its minimum magnitude is 14.8,  
 Z And is the M-type prototype for its class of variable stars. It ranges in magnitude from a minimum of 12.4 to a maximum of 8.0.  
 Ross 248 (HH Andromedae) is the ninth closest star to Earth at a distance of 10.3 light-years.  
 14 And is a yellow-hued giant star of type G8 that is 251 light-years away.  
 
 Deep-sky objects  
 
 
 
  
M31, the Great Galaxy of Andromeda. 
 
 
 The constellation of Andromeda lies well away from the galactic plane , so it does not contain any of the open clusters or bright nebulae of the Milky Way. Because of its distance in the sky from the band of obscuring dust, gas, and abundant stars of our home galaxy, Andromeda's borders contain many visible distant galaxies.  
 M31 is often referred to as a twin sister to the Milky Way, but it has only half the mass of the Milky Way despite being twice its diameter.  
 American astronomer Edwin Hubble included M31 (then known as the Andromeda Nebula) in his groundbreaking 1923 research on galaxies.  
 The Andromeda Galaxy's two main companions, M32 and M110 (also known as NGC 221 and NGC 205, respectively) are faint elliptical galaxies that lie near it.  
 The Andromeda Galaxy has a total of 15 satellite galaxies , including M32 and M110. Nine of these lie in a plane, which has caused astronomers to infer that they have a common origin. These satellite galaxies, like the satellites of the Milky Way , tend to be older, gas-poor dwarf elliptical and dwarf spheroidal galaxies .

 Along with the Andromeda Galaxy and its companions, the constellation also features NGC 891 (Caldwell 23), a smaller galaxy just east of Almach . It is a barred spiral galaxy seen edge-on, with a dark dust lane visible down the middle. NGC 891 is incredibly faint and small despite its magnitude of 9.9,  
 Andromeda's most celebrated open cluster is NGC 752 ( Caldwell 28) at an overall magnitude of 5.7.  
 There is one prominent planetary nebula in Andromeda: NGC 7662 (Caldwell 22).  
 Meteor showers  
 Each November, the Andromedids meteor shower appears to radiate from Andromeda.
