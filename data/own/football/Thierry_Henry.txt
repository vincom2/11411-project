 Thierry Daniel Henry ( French pronunciation:&#160;​  ; born 17 August 1977) is a French footballer who plays as a striker for New York Red Bulls in Major League Soccer . Henry was born in Les Ulis , Essonne (a suburb of Paris) where he played for an array of local sides as a youngster and showed great promise as a goal-scorer. He was spotted by AS Monaco in 1990 and signed instantly, making his professional debut in 1994. Good form led to an international call-up in 1998, after which he signed for the Serie A defending champions Juventus . He had a disappointing season playing on the wing , before joining Arsenal for £ 11&#160;million in 1999. 
 It was at Arsenal that Henry made his name as a world-class footballer. Despite initially struggling in the Premier League , he emerged as Arsenal's top goal-scorer for almost every season of his tenure there. Under long-time mentor and coach Arsène Wenger , Henry became a prolific striker and Arsenal's all-time leading scorer with 228 goals in all competitions. The Frenchman won two league titles and three FA Cups with the Gunners; he was nominated for the FIFA World Player of the Year twice, was named the PFA Players' Player of the Year twice, and the FWA Footballer of the Year three times. Henry spent his final two seasons with Arsenal as club captain , leading them to the 2006 UEFA Champions League Final . 
 In June 2007, after eight years with Arsenal, he transferred to Barcelona for a fee of €24&#160;million. His first honours with the Spanish club came in 2009 when they won the La Liga , Copa del Rey and Champions League treble. He went on to achieve an unprecedented sextuple by also winning the Supercopa de España , the UEFA Super Cup and the FIFA Club World Cup . In total, Henry has been named in the UEFA Team of the Year five times. In 2010, he joined the New York Red Bulls of the Major League Soccer , and won the Eastern Conference title with them in 2010. He returned to Arsenal on loan for two months in 2012. In 2013 Henry with the New York Red Bulls won the MLS Supporters' Shield . 
 Henry enjoyed similar success with the French national team , having won the 1998 FIFA World Cup , UEFA Euro 2000 and 2003 FIFA Confederations Cup . In October 2007, he surpassed Michel Platini 's record to become France's top goal-scorer of all time. Henry retired from international football after the 2010 FIFA World Cup . Off the pitch, Henry is an active spokesperson against racism in football , partially due to his own experiences. He married English model Nicole Merry in 2003 and had a daughter with her, but they divorced in 2007. Henry was also one of the top commercially marketed footballers; he was ranked ninth in the world in 2006.

 Early years 
 Henry is of Antillean heritage:  
 Club career 
 Monaco (1992–1999) and Juventus (1999) 
 In 1990, Monaco sent scout Arnold Catalano to watch Henry, then at the age of 13 in a match.  
 After a tentative start to his Monaco career, Henry was named the French Young Footballer of the Year in 1996, and in the 1996–97 season , his solid performances helped the club win the Ligue 1 title.  
 Henry left Monaco in January 1999, one year before his friend and teammate David Trezeguet , and moved to Italian Serie A club Juventus for £10.5&#160;million.  
 Arsenal (1999–2007) 
 
 
 
  
Henry was made captain following the departure of fellow Frenchman Patrick Vieira to Juventus in 2005 
 
 
 Unsettled in Italy, Henry transferred from Juventus on 3 August 1999 to Arsenal for an estimated fee of £11&#160;million, reuniting with his former manager Arsène Wenger.  
 Coming off the back of a victorious UEFA Euro 2000 campaign with the national team, Henry was ready to make an impact in the 2000–01 season . Despite recording fewer goals and assists than his first season, Henry's second season with Arsenal proved to be a breakthrough, as he became the club's top goalscorer.  
 Success finally arrived during the 2001–02 season . Arsenal finished seven points above Liverpool to win the Premier League title, and defeated Chelsea 2–0 in the FA Cup Final .  
 2002–03 proved to be another productive season for Henry, as he scored 32 goals in all competitions while contributing 23 assists—remarkable returns for a striker.

 Entering the 2003–04 season , Arsenal were determined to reclaim the Premier League crown. Henry was again instrumental in Arsenal's exceptionally successful campaign; together with the likes of Dennis Bergkamp , Patrick Vieira and Robert Pirès , Henry ensured that the Gunners became the first team in more than a century to go through the entire domestic league season unbeaten , claiming the league title in the process.  
 This dip in success was compounded when Arsenal failed again to secure back-to-back league titles when they lost out to Chelsea in the 2004–05 season , although Arsenal did win the FA Cup (the Final of which Henry missed through injury).  
 
 
 
  
After the retirement of Dennis Bergkamp , Henry regularly partnered Robin van Persie up front in the Arsenal attack 
 
 
 The 2005–06 season proved to be one of remarkable personal achievements for Henry. On 17 October 2005, Henry became the club's top goal-scorer of all time ;  
 Nevertheless, Arsenal failed to win the Premier League title again, but hopes of a trophy were revived when Arsenal reached the 2006 UEFA Champions League Final . The Gunners eventually lost 2–1 to Barcelona , and Arsenal's inability to win the league title for two consecutive seasons combined with the relative inexperience of the Arsenal squad caused much speculation that Henry would leave for another club. However, he declared his love for the club and accepted a four-year contract, and said he would stay at Arsenal for life.  
 Henry's 2006–07 season was marred by injuries.  
 Barcelona (2007–2010)

 On 25 June 2007, in an unexpected turn of events, Henry was transferred to Barcelona for €24&#160;million. He signed a four-year deal for a reported €6.8 (£4.6) million per season.

 At Barcelona, Henry was given the number 14 jersey, the same as he had worn at Arsenal. He scored his first goal for his new club on 19 September 2007 in a 3–0 Champions League group stage win over Olympique Lyonnais ,  However, Henry concluded his debut season as the club's top scorer with 19 goals in addition to nine league assists, second behind Lionel Messi 's 10. 
 Henry went on to surpass this tally in a more integrated 2008–09 campaign, winning the first trophy of his Barcelona career on 13 May 2009 when Barcelona defeated Athletic Bilbao in the Copa del Rey final . Barcelona won the Primera División and Champions League soon after, completing a treble for the Frenchman, who had combined with Lionel Messi and Samuel Eto'o to score 100 goals between them that season. The trio was also the most prolific trio in Spanish league history, scoring 72 goals and surpassing the 66 goals of Real Madrid 's Ferenc Puskás , Alfredo Di Stéfano and Luis del Sol of the 1960–61 season (this was later surpassed by Real Madrid trio Cristiano Ronaldo , Karim Benzema and Gonzalo Higuain who scored 89 goals in 2011–12 ).  
 The following season , the emergence of Pedro Rodríguez meant that Henry only started 15 league games.  
 New York Red Bulls (2010–present)

 In July 2010, Henry signed a multi-year contract with Major League Soccer (MLS) club New York Red Bulls for the 2010 season as its second designated player .  
 After training with Arsenal during the MLS off-season, Henry re-signed for the club on a two-month loan deal on 6 January 2012. This was to provide cover for Gervinho and Marouane Chamakh , who were unavailable due to their participation in the 2012 Africa Cup of Nations .  
 On 31 March 2012, Henry scored his first MLS hat-trick in a 5–2 Red Bulls win over Montreal Impact .  
 International career 
 Henry enjoyed a successful career with the France national team , winning the first of his 123 caps in June 1997, when his good form for Monaco was rewarded with a call-up to the Under-20 French national team , where he played in the 1997 FIFA World Youth Championship alongside future teammates William Gallas and David Trézéguet .  
 Henry was a member of France's UEFA Euro 2000 squad , again scoring three goals in the tournament, including the equaliser against Portugal in the semi-final , and finishing as the country's top scorer.  
 The 2002 FIFA World Cup featured a stunning early exit for both Henry and France as the defending champions were eliminated in the group stage after failing to score a goal in all three games.  
 Henry returned to form for his country at the 2003 FIFA Confederations Cup . Despite playing without team stalwarts Zidane and Patrick Vieira , France won, in large part owing to Henry's outstanding play, for which he was named Man of the Match by FIFA 's Technical Study Group in three of France's five matches.  
 In UEFA Euro 2004 , Henry played in all of France's matches and scored two goals.  
 On 13 October 2007, Henry scored his 41st goal against the Faroe Islands , joining Michel Platini as the country's top goal-scorer of all time.  
 Henry missed the opening game of France's short-lived UEFA Euro 2008 campaign, where they were eliminated in the group stages after being drawn in the same group as Italy, the Netherlands and Romania .  
 The French team struggled during the 2010 FIFA World Cup qualifiers and finished second in their group behind Serbia . During the play-offs against the Republic of Ireland , Henry was involved in a controversy in the second leg of the game at the Stade de France on 18 November 2009. With the aggregate score tied at 1–1 and the game in extra time, he used his hand twice to control the ball before delivering a cross to William Gallas who scored the winner.  
 Henry did not feature in the starting line-up for France at the 2010 FIFA World Cup. France drew in their first game against Uruguay, and lost 2–0 in their second against Mexico . The team was thrown into disarray when Nicolas Anelka was expelled from the team, and captain Patrice Evra led a team protest by refusing to train.  
 Style of play 
 
 
 
  
Henry was the first-choice free kick taker for Arsenal 
 
 
 Although Henry played up front as a striker during his youth,  
 One of the reasons cited for Henry's impressive play up front is his ability to calmly score from one-on-ones.

 Outside football 
 Personal and family life 
 Henry married English model Nicole Merry, real name Claire, on 5 July 2003.  
 As a fan of the National Basketball Association (NBA), Henry is often seen with his friend Tony Parker at games when not playing football. Henry stated in an interview that he admires basketball, as it is similar to football in pace and excitement.  
 Social causes 
 UNICEF 
 Henry is a member of the UNICEF -FIFA squad, where together with other professional footballers he appeared in a series of TV spots seen by hundreds of millions of fans around the world during the 2002 and 2006 FIFA World Cups. In these spots, the players promote football as a game that must be played on behalf of children.  
 Stand Up Speak Up 
 Having been subjected to racism in the past, Henry is an active spokesperson against racism in football . The most prominent incident of racism against Henry was during a training session with the Spanish national team in 2004,  
 Other work 
 Along with 45 other football players, Henry took part in FIFA's " Live for Love United " in 2002. The single was released in tandem with the 2002 FIFA World Cup and its proceeds went towards AIDS research. Henry also supports the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation and Cystic Fibrosis Trust .  
 On August 2013, in partnership with Goldman Sachs Gives, Henry agreed to donate $5,000 to international nonprofit organisation Grassroot Soccer each time he scores a goal, and $2,500 each time he makes an assist for the rest of the 2013 MLS season.  
 Endorsements 
 In 2006, Henry was valued as the ninth most commercially marketable footballer in the world,  
 Renault 
 Henry featured in the Renault Clio advertisements in which he popularised the term va-va-voom , meaning "life" or "passion". His romantic interest in the commercial was his then-girlfriend, later his wife (now divorced), Claire Merry. "Va-va-voom" was subsequently added to the Concise Oxford English Dictionary .  
 Nike 
 In 2004, Henry signed with sportswear giant Nike . In one of the advertisements, Henry pits his wits against football stars such as Claude Makélélé , Edgar Davids and Freddie Ljungberg in locations such as his bedroom and living room. The advertisement was partly inspired by Henry himself, who revealed that he always has a football nearby, even at home.  
 Reebok 
 Henry's deal with Nike ended after the 2006 FIFA World Cup, when he signed a deal with Reebok to appear in their "I Am What I Am" campaign.  
 Puma 
 In 2011 Henry switched to Puma boots,  first wearing the brand in the 2011 MLS All Star game against Manchester United, before announcing a multi-year partnership for Puma to be his performance and lifestyle footwear and apparel sponsor. His first official game with Puma was in the Emirates Cup against former club Arsenal. 
 Gillette 
 In February 2007, Henry was named as one of the three ambassadors of Gillette 's "Champions Program," which purported to feature three of the "best-known, most widely respected and successful athletes competing today" and also showcased Roger Federer and Tiger Woods in a series of television commercials.  
 Pepsi 
 Henry was part of Pepsi 's "Dare For More" campaign in 2005, alongside the likes of David Beckham and Ronaldinho .
