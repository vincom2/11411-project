 Club career 
 Early career 
 Born in Barking , east London, Terry attended Eastbury Comprehensive School  
 Early time with Chelsea 
 Terry made his Chelsea debut on 28 October 1998 as a late substitute in a League Cup tie with Aston Villa ; his first start came later that season in an FA Cup third round match, a 2–0 win over Oldham Athletic . He spent a brief period on loan with Nottingham Forest in 2000 to build up his first team experience and was the subject of interest from both Forest manager David Platt and Huddersfield Town manager Steve Bruce .  
 In 2002 Terry was involved in an altercation with a bouncer at a West London nightclub with Chelsea team mate Jody Morris and Wimbledon 's Des Byrne , which led to him being charged with assault and affray . In August 2002 Terry was acquitted of the charges in court.  
 First-team regular 
 Terry began to establish himself in the Chelsea first team from the 2000–01 season , making 23 starts, and was voted the club's player of the year.  He continued his progress during 2001–02 , becoming a regular in the defence alongside club captain and French international Marcel Desailly . On 5 December 2001 he captained Chelsea for the first time, in a League match against Charlton Athletic . Chelsea reached the FA Cup final , following wins against London rivals West Ham and Tottenham in the fourth and six rounds respectively, and Fulham in the semi-final – where Terry scored the only goal in a 1–0 victory. A virus denied Terry a place in the starting line-up for the final , although he came on as a second-half substitute as Chelsea lost 2–0 to Arsenal . In season 2003–04, his performances led to him being handed the captain's armband by manager Claudio Ranieri , when Desailly was out of the side. He played well in the absence of the French international, forming a strong defensive partnership with William Gallas .

 2004–05 season 
 Following Desailly's retirement, new Chelsea manager José Mourinho chose Terry as his club captain, a choice which was vindicated throughout the 2004–05 season as Chelsea won the Premier League title in record-breaking fashion with the best defensive record in Football League history with the most clean sheets and the most points accrued. He was voted Player of the Year by his fellow professionals in England  
 2005–06 season 
 Chelsea defended their Premier League title in 2005–06 , earning 91 points, and confirming the title with a 3–0 victory against Manchester United .

 2006–07 season 
 In a match on 14 October 2006 against Reading , Terry had to take over in goal for Chelsea in the final minutes of the match after goalkeepers Petr Čech and Carlo Cudicini were injured and Chelsea had no substitutes remaining. He wore the number 40 shirt belonging to third-choice goalkeeper Henrique Hilário . Terry kept a clean sheet as Chelsea held out to win 1–0, although he did not have a single save to make and his goalkeeping experience was limited to taking a free-kick from inside the penalty area. On 5 November 2006, playing against Tottenham Hotspur , Terry was sent off for the first time in his Chelsea career after receiving two yellow cards as Chelsea lost at White Hart Lane for the first time since 1987. Terry was charged with misconduct by the FA for questioning the integrity of match referee Graham Poll after the game. On 10 January 2007, John Terry was ordered to pay £10,000 for the inappropriate conduct after he changed his mind and pleaded guilty to the FA.

 In the 2006–2007 season Terry missed matches for Chelsea due to a recurring back problem. After a draw with Reading on 26 December 2006, José Mourinho stated that his captain might require surgery to fix the problem. In the games that he had missed, Chelsea had conceded six goals. On 28 December Chelsea released a press statement saying Terry had had back surgery: "The operation to remove a sequestrated lumbar intervertebral disc was successful."  Lewin was the first medic that rushed over to assist him after his tongue had blocked his airways. After spending two weeks on the sidelines, he made his return to the Chelsea team against Blackburn in March. He went on to lead Chelsea to the semi-finals of the Champions League , the third time in four years that Chelsea had made it to the final four of the competition. In May 2007, Terry captained Chelsea to the FA Cup , in the first final at the new Wembley Stadium . 
 Despite failing to agree terms to a new contract immediately following the 2006–2007 season, Terry stated on several occasions that he had no intention of leaving Chelsea. In late July he signed a new five-year contract  
 2007–08 season 
 On 16 December 2007 whilst playing against Arsenal, while going to clear a ball Terry's foot was stepped on by Emmanuel Eboué and Terry had suffered 3 broken bones in his foot. He was expected to be out for at least three months but made a speedy recovery and managed to captain Chelsea to the 2008 League Cup final against Tottenham, which Chelsea lost 2–1. On 11 May 2008 whilst playing in the last league game of the season against Bolton, he collided with goalkeeper, Petr Čech , and suffered a partially dislocated elbow which was put back in while in the ambulance on the way to hospital. This injury did not prevent him playing in the Champions League final against Manchester United . The match went to penalties , and Terry missed a penalty which would have won Chelsea the match (and the Champions League). His standing leg slipped as he took his kick, and the ball missed the goal. Chelsea lost the shootout 6–5, which Terry reacted to by breaking down in tears. On 28 August 2008, Terry was awarded the Defender of The Year award from UEFA at the UEFA Champions League Group Stage Draw in Monaco, together with Frank Lampard and Petr Čech who received the award on their respective positions. 
 2008–09 season 
 On 13 September 2008, Terry received the first straight red card of his career against Manchester City for rugby-tackling Jô . However, this was later rescinded on appeal.

 Along with Frank Lampard , Didier Drogba and Petr Čech , Terry is regarded as a part of the spine of the Chelsea team. He has won seven trophies as Chelsea captain (one more than Dennis Wise )  
 In July 2009, Manchester City made a third bid for Terry, but Chelsea coach Carlo Ancelotti has insisted Terry will remain at Chelsea.  Before the start of the season, Terry was again awarded with UEFA Defender of the Year, his 3rd time winning the award. John Terry made his debut for the new season against Premier League side Hull City , a match Chelsea won.

 On 8 November 2009, Terry scored the decisive goal in Chelsea's match against Manchester United at Stamford Bridge to preserve their perfect home record for the season. 
 On 9 May 2010, Terry captained Chelsea as they won their fourth League title after an 8–0 win against Wigan Athletic at Stamford Bridge .  
 2010–11 season 
 On 31 December 2011, in a home match against Aston Villa, Terry captained the Chelsea side for the 400th time of his career, a record for the club.  
 Terry was the world's third best passer in 2011 for players with over 1000 passes, with a 91.6% pass accuracy rate. Only Barcelona player Xavi (93.0%) and Swansea City player Leon Britton (93.3%) were better.  
 2011–12 season

 On 24 April 2012, Terry was sent off for violent conduct after driving a knee into Barcelona 's Alexis Sanchez in an off-the-ball incident in the 2011–12 UEFA Champions League semi-final at the Camp Nou . Chelsea's 3–2 aggregate victory over the holders qualified them for the final against Bayern München , for which Terry will be suspended. Terry later apologised for letting his team-mates and Chelsea fans down.

 International career 
 
 
 
  
Terry playing for England in 2010 
 
 
 Terry made his England debut in June 2003 against Serbia and Montenegro , and started his first game for England on 20 August 2003 at Portman Road , Ipswich , in a friendly against Croatia . England won the game 3–1. His main central defensive partner has been Rio Ferdinand . He played for his country at Euro 2004 , and England Manager Sven-Göran Eriksson stated that Terry was the first-choice centre back, ahead of Sol Campbell .  
 In a FIFA World Cup Qualifying match against Poland , Terry had the honour of wearing England's captain armband, replacing Michael Owen as captain after the latter was subbed. 
 He has cemented his place in the England squad by being selected for the 2006 FIFA World Cup . In a warm-up match for that tournament against Hungary on 30 May 2006, Terry scored his first goal for England, the team's second in a 3–1 victory. Despite an injury scare in a friendly against Jamaica , he recovered to play in England's opening fixture against Paraguay , a 1–0 victory. 
 In the next match against Trinidad and Tobago , Carlos Edwards beat England's Paul Robinson to a cross and as Stern John bundled a header towards the goal, Terry cleared the ball off the line with an overhead kick. In the quarter-finals match against Portugal, Terry played the entire match, but England lost on penalties and he was left in tears with his fellow players. Six days later, he was the only English player to be named in the tournament's all-star squad.  
 On 10 August 2006, Steve McClaren named John Terry as the England captain, succeeding David Beckham . McClaren said, "Choosing a captain is one of the most important decisions a coach has to make. I'm certain I've got the right man in John Terry. I'm convinced he will prove to be one of the best captains England has ever had."  
 On 1 June 2007, Terry became the first player in the senior England team to score an international goal at the new Wembley Stadium when he scored England's goal in a 1–1 draw with Brazil. He scored from a header in the box after a free kick cross by David Beckham. Almost a year later, he scored a similar headed goal once again from a freekick cross by David Beckham to put England 1–0 up against the USA on 28 May 2008. 
 Terry was confirmed as the England captain in August, and captained England in qualifying for the 2010 World Cup . During his first match after being reinstated as the permanent England captain he was given a torrid time by Milan Baroš and was turned far too easily when Baros scored the first goal for the Czech Republic. The match ended 2–2 with Joe Cole scoring a fortunate equaliser for England in the 92nd minute of the game. He scored his first competitive England goal against Ukraine in the qualifiers for the World Cup, grabbing a late winner after earlier giving away a free kick which saw Andriy Shevchenko equalise for Ukraine. 
 
 
 
  
Terry with England at Euro 2012 
 
 
 On 5 February 2010, following allegations regarding Terry's private life , England manager Fabio Capello announced that Terry was removed as the captain of the England team.  
 At the 2010 FIFA World Cup finals, England started with two draws against the USA and Algeria which received heavy criticism from the English media.

 Two days after the Algeria game in a media interview, Terry hinted at dissatisfaction with Capello's team selection and stated that the players were bored with little to do in the evenings at their training base; he also said that a clear-the-air team meeting would take place that evening.  
 On 19 March 2011, Capello reinstated Terry as England captain following a long term injury to previous captain Rio Ferdinand.  
 Terry was named in new manager Roy Hodgson 's squad for Euro 2012 while Rio Ferdinand was left out, leading to heavy speculation that this was to avoid potential conflict due to Terry's upcoming trial for racially abusing Ferdinand's brother Anton.  Terry played 90 minutes in all four of England's matches at the Euros. 
 John Terry played the first World Cup Qualifying game against Moldova before leaving the field with an ankle injury meaning he missed the game vs Ukraine . 
 Terry announced on 23 September 2012 he had retired from international football.

 Terry's older brother, Paul (born 1979), is also professional footballer currently with Conference South side Thurrock F.C. . Terry currently lives in Oxshott , Surrey. 
 Despite being a one club man with Chelsea in his professional career, Terry was a Manchester United supporter growing up.  
 Terry is one of a very small group of footballers to have been paid more than £1&#160;million for their autobiography.  
 Controversies 
 In September 2001, Terry and three teammates were fined two weeks' wages by Chelsea for an incident involving players and American tourists at a Heathrow airport bar in the immediate aftermath of the 11 September attacks .  
 Extramarital affair allegations 
 Further information: John Terry (previously 'LNS') v Persons Unknown 
 In January 2010, a super-injunction was imposed by a High Court judge preventing the media from reporting allegations that Terry had had a four-month affair in late 2009 with Vanessa Perroncel, the former girlfriend of Wayne Bridge , his former Chelsea and England teammate.  
 Racial abuse allegations 
 Further information: R v John Terry 
 On 2 November 2011, Terry was placed under police investigation following an allegation of racist abuse made at Anton Ferdinand during a match versus Queens Park Rangers .  
 When the trial began in July 2012, Terry entered a not guilty plea and was acquitted of the charge on 13 July 2012. The court established that neither Ferdinand nor anyone else had heard Terry's words, but Terry himself admitted that he had directed the words "fucking black cunt" and "fucking knobhead" at Ferdinand, which was affirmed by two expert lip readers from video evidence. Terry maintained that he used the words as a form of sarcasm and that he was questioning what he thought had been an allegation of racism from Ferdinand; neither lip reader was able to "identify whether the statement was made as a question or in what type of voice it was said". Justice Riddle concluded that while there was no doubt Terry had uttered those words in anger, "it is impossible to be sure exactly what were the words spoken by  
 On 27 July 2012, the Football Association charged Terry for using "abusive and/or insulting words and/or behaviour" which "included a reference to the ethnic origin and/or colour and/or race of Ferdinand". The FA had delayed the charge until after the conclusion of Terry's criminal trial. Terry denied the charge.  
 The FA published a 63-page report  
 On 18 October 2012, Terry decided not to appeal against the verdict and his four-match ban. He issued an apology for "the language  
 In The Daily Telegraph , Paul Hayward summed up his view of the consequences of the controversial incident, that "the cost has been high. Here, three vile words muttered by Terry at Loftus Road ultimately removed Fabio Capello from the England manager’s job; inflicted much distress on the Ferdinand family; brought a £45,000 fine for Rio Ferdinand for his endorsement of a “choc ice” tweet aimed at Chelsea’s left-back; removed Terry from the England reckoning and shed yet more light on the fantasy world of Ashley Cole."  
 In popular culture 
 Immediately after Terry's celebration with his Chelsea teammates after their 2012 UEFA Champions League Final victory, a popular internet meme lampooning his behaviour appeared on the internet, becoming one of the most popular online jokes in 2012.  
 The joke reached its height when in October 2012, a Sligo Rovers fan donned a John Terry mask and full Chelsea kit, invading the pitch at the Showgrounds . The fan was photographed celebrating with his team winning the 2012 League of Ireland .
