 Personal life 
 In addition to Everton, Rooney also supports Celtic .  
 Rooney gave up boxing to pursue a career in football when he originally joined Everton, but he still uses boxing as a way to curb his temper.  
 In June 2011, he visited the Harley Street Hair Clinic and had a hair transplant .  
 It was announced in July 2011, that jerseys with Rooney's name and number were the best-selling sports product under the auspices of the Premier League. During the 2009–10 season, Manchester United sold between 1.2&#160;million and 1.5&#160;million shirts and it is estimated that of that, Rooney's name was printed on several hundred thousand. The account is taken from official jerseys sales across the globe, not just in England.  
 Family 
 
 
 
  
Rooney's wife, Coleen , in October 2006 
 
 
 Rooney met his wife, Coleen Rooney (née McLoughlin), while both were at secondary school.  
 In April 2006, he was awarded £100,000 in libel damages from tabloids The Sun and News of the World , who had claimed that he had assaulted Coleen in a nightclub. Rooney donated the money to charity.  
 The Rooneys reside in a £4.25&#160;million mansion in the village of Prestbury, Cheshire ,  
 Rooney's wife Coleen gave birth to a son on 2 November 2009.  The couple's second child, another boy, was born on 21 May 2013. 
 Rooney's younger brother, John Rooney , is also a professional footballer who plays for Chester . He has previously played with Macclesfield Town , Barnsley and Bury , and in January 2011 signed a contract to play in Major League Soccer in the United States.  
 Commercial interests 
 Rooney has endorsement deals with Nike (he is the face of their T90 Laser IV boots  
 On 9 March 2006, Rooney signed the largest sports book deal in publishing history with HarperCollins ,  
 In July 2006, Rooney's lawyers went to the United Nations' World Intellectual Property Organisation to gain ownership of the Internet domain names waynerooney.com and waynerooney.co.uk, both of which Welsh actor Huw Marshall registered in 2002.  
 Paul Stretford controversy 
 In July 2002, while Rooney was with Everton, agent Paul Stretford encouraged Rooney and his parents to enter the player into an eight-year contract with Proactive Sports Management. However, Rooney was already with another representation firm at the time, while Stretford's transaction went unreported to the FA, and he was thus charged with improper conduct. Stretford alleged in his October 2004 trial that he had secretly recorded boxing promoter John Hyland (an associate of Rooney's first agent) and two other men threatening and attempting to blackmail him for an undisclosed percentage of Rooney's earnings.  
 Stretford's case collapsed due to evidence that conflicted with his insistence that he had not signed Rooney, and on 9 July 2008, he was found guilty of "making of false and/or misleading witness statements to police, and giving false and/or misleading testimony."  
 Stretford left Proactive in 2008 and took Rooney with him. Proactive later sued Rooney, claiming £4.3&#160;million in withheld commissions. In July 2010, Proactive was awarded only £90,000 as restitution.  
 David Moyes 
 On 1 September 2006, Everton manager David Moyes sued Rooney for libel after the tabloid newspaper the Daily Mail published excerpts from Rooney's 2006 autobiography that accused the manager of leaking Rooney's reasons for leaving the club to the press.  
 Allegations of infidelity 
 Prostitute Helen Wood claims Rooney paid £1,000 for a threesome with her and Jennifer Thompson in a Manchester hotel whilst Coleen was five months pregnant.
