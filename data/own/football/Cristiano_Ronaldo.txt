 Cristiano Ronaldo dos Santos Aveiro ,  
 Ronaldo began his career as a youth player for Andorinha , where he played for two years, before moving to C.D. Nacional . In 1997, he made a move to Portuguese giants Sporting Clube de Portugal . Ronaldo caught the attention of Manchester United manager Alex Ferguson , who signed him for £12.24&#160;million (€15&#160;million) in 2003. In 2004, Ronaldo won his first club honour, the FA Cup . 
 Ronaldo was the first player playing in England to win all four main PFA and FWA awards, doing so in 2007. In 2008 and 2013, Ronaldo won the FIFA / Ballon d'Or award for the best footballer on the planet, being the first ever Portuguese to win the award twice.  In 2007 and 2008, Ronaldo was named FWA Footballer of the Year . Ronaldo was the inaugural winner of the FIFA Puskás Award for the Goal of the Year in 2009. 
 Ronaldo is the first top European league player to reach 40 goals in a single season in two consecutive years, fastest Real Madrid player to reach one hundred league goals, and the first player ever to score against every team in a single season in La Liga.  After spending his first year at Madrid wearing the number 9 shirt, he began wearing the number 7 again following the departure of long-serving striker Raúl . Ronaldo had previously worn the number 7 shirt at Manchester United. 
 Ronaldo is a Portuguese international and made his debut in August 2003. He has been capped over 100 times and is his country's top goalscorer of all time. With Portugal he has participated in five major tournaments; UEFA Euro 2004 , the 2006 FIFA World Cup , UEFA Euro 2008 , the 2010 FIFA World Cup and UEFA Euro 2012 . He scored his first international goal in the opening game of Euro 2004 against Greece , in addition to helping Portugal reach the final .

 Early life 
 Ronaldo was born in Santo António , a neighbourhood of Funchal , Madeira , the youngest child of Maria Dolores dos Santos Aveiro, a cook, and José Dinis Aveiro, a municipal gardener.  
 The family was staunchly Catholic and Ronaldo later claimed that he lived in poverty, sharing a room with his brother and sisters.  
 Club career 
 Early career 
 At the age of eight, Ronaldo played for amateur team Andorinha , where his father was the kit man . In 1995, Ronaldo signed with local club Nacional , and, after a title-winning campaign, he went on a three-day trial with Sporting CP , who subsequently signed him for an undisclosed sum.  
 Sporting CP 
 Ronaldo joined Sporting's other youth players who trained at the Academia Sporting , the club's football academy, in Alcochete . He became the only player ever to play for Sporting's under-16, under-17, under-18, B-team, and the first team, all within one season.  
 At the age of 15 Ronaldo was diagnosed with a racing heart , a condition that might have forced him to give up playing football. The Sporting staff were made aware of the condition and Ronaldo's mother gave her authorisation for him to go into hospital.  
 In November 2002, Ronaldo was invited to Arsenal 's training ground, London Colney to meet manager Arsène Wenger and his coaching staff.  
 On April 2013, Ronaldo was honoured by Sporting as the club announced that the player had become their 100,000th member.

 Ronaldo became Manchester United 's first-ever Portuguese player when he signed for €15&#160;million  
 Ronaldo made his team debut as a 60th-minute substitute in a 4–0 home victory over Bolton Wanderers . He scored his first goal for Manchester United with a free kick in a 3–0 win over Portsmouth on 1 November 2003. Ronaldo ended his first season in English football by scoring the opening goal in United's 3–0 FA Cup final victory over Millwall .  
 He scored United's 1000th Premier League goal on 29 October 2005 in a 4–1 loss to Middlesbrough .  He scored ten goals in all competitions, and fans voted him to his first FIFPro Special Young Player of the Year award in 2005. 
 He was sent off in the Manchester derby at the City of Manchester Stadium on 14 January 2006 (a game which United lost 3–1) for kicking City's former United player Andrew Cole .

 The 2006–2007 season proved to be the breakout year for Ronaldo, as he broke the 20 goal barrier for the first time and picked up his first league title with Manchester United. An important factor in this success was his one-to-one training by first team coach René Meulensteen . Meulensteen coached him in moves to make himself more unpredictable. He also helped him to work better with his team-mates, calling for the ball and scoring more 'ugly' goals instead of waiting for the special occasion when he could score the 'beautiful' goals for which he was already famous.  
 In November and December 2006, Ronaldo received consecutive Barclays Player of the Month honours, becoming only the third player in Premier League history to do so after Dennis Bergkamp in 1997 and Robbie Fowler in 1996.  He scored his 50th Manchester United goal against city rivals Manchester City on 5 May 2007 as United claimed their first Premier League title in four years, and he was voted into his second consecutive FIFPro Special Young Player of the Year award at the end of the year. 
 Despite rumours circulating in March 2007 that Real Madrid were willing to pay an unprecedented €80&#160;million (£54&#160;million) for Ronaldo,  
 Ronaldo amassed a host of personal awards for the season. He won the PFA Players' Player of the Year and PFA Young Player of the Year awards, joining Andy Gray (in 1977 ) as the only players to receive this honour.  In April, he completed the treble by winning the PFA Fans' Player of the Year . He also won the FWA Footballer of the Year , becoming the first player to win all four main PFA and FWA awards. Ronaldo was also one of eight Manchester United players named in the 2006–07 PFA Premier League Team of the Year .

 Ronaldo's 2007–08 season began with a red card for a headbutt on Portsmouth player Richard Hughes during United's second match of the season, for which he was punished with a three-match ban.  
 He finished as the runner-up to Kaká for the 2007 Ballon d'Or ,  
 Ronaldo scored his first hat-trick for Manchester United in a 6–0 win against Newcastle United at Old Trafford on 12 January 2008, bringing Manchester United up to the top of the Premier League table.  
 On 19 March 2008, Ronaldo captained United for the first time in his career in a home win over Bolton, scoring both goals in the 2–0 victory.

 In the 2007–08 Champions League final on 21 May against league rivals Chelsea , Ronaldo scored the opening goal after 26 minutes, which was negated by a Chelsea equaliser in the 45th minute as the match ended 1–1 after extra time. His misfire in the penalty shoot-out put Chelsea in position to win the trophy, but John Terry shot wide right after slipping on the pitch surface, and Manchester United emerged victorious 6–5 on penalties. Ronaldo was named the UEFA Fans' Man of the Match,  and wrapped up the campaign with a career-high 42 goals in all competitions, falling four short of Denis Law 's team-record mark of 46 in the 1963–64 season. In the Champions League he was also named best forward and player of the tournament and was the competition's top goalscorer .

 On 8 January 2009, Ronaldo was uninjured in a single-car accident in which he wrote off his Ferrari 599 GTB Fiorano in a tunnel along the A538 near Manchester Airport . A breathalyser test he gave to police officers at the scene was negative, and he attended training later that morning.  
 Ronaldo scored his first Champions League goal of the season, and first since the final against Chelsea in a 2–0 victory over Internazionale that sent United into the quarter-finals.  Ronaldo participated in his second consecutive Champions League final , but made little impact in United's 2–0 loss to Barcelona. He finished with 53 appearances in all competitions, which was four higher than the previous year, but scored sixteen fewer goals (26) than his career-best total of 42 from the previous season. 
 On 11 June, Manchester United accepted an unconditional offer of £80&#160;million from Real Madrid for Ronaldo after it was revealed that he again had expressed his desire to leave the club.

 I have nothing but praise for the boy. He is easily the best player in the world. His contribution as a goal threat is unbelievable. His stats are incredible. Strikes at goal, attempts on goal, raids into the penalty box, headers. It is all there. Absolutely astounding.

 Ronaldo began 2011 with a very promising outlook, especially after Real Madrid acknowledged he had broken numerous goalscoring records, previously settled and held by classic players such as Alfredo Di Stéfano , Hugo Sánchez , and Manuel Alday .  He then consolidated his massive performances by scoring a hat-trick and assisting Kaká to score his first league goal after his return from injury in a 4–2 victory over Villarreal on 9 January. On 3 March 2011, Ronaldo scored a hat-trick in a 7–0 trashing of Málaga , but was affected by a muscle injury at the end of the match, which forced him to spend 10 days on the sidelines.

 In April, he made another massive comeback from injury, sustaining a three-game scoring streak (including two goals in Champions League quarter-finals against Tottenham Hotspur ), thus arriving to the first of a historical series of four El Clásico encounters two goals short of breaking his personal record of 42 goals in all competitions in a single season, achieved at Manchester United in the 2007–08 season. 
 During the second league edition of El Clásico, Ronaldo scored from the penalty spot and took his tally to 41 goals, also taking his scoring streak to four games. On 20 April, Ronaldo scored the winning goal against Barcelona in the 103rd minute of the Copa del Rey final .  Three days later he reached 49 goals for the season, by scoring another hat-trick in a 4–0 home win against Getafe . On 15 May, after scoring two free-kick goals in a 3–1 win over Villarreal , he equalled the La Liga record with most goals in a season with 38, a record previously held by Telmo Zarra and Hugo Sánchez . 
 On 21 May, he scored two goals in the last league match of the season against Almería, taking his Pichichi total to 41, and La Liga total to 40, becoming the only player to score 40 goals in a La Liga season. By doing this, he won the European Golden Shoe award once again, becoming the first player to win the trophy in two different leagues.

 In the first weeks of September, Ronaldo's physical performance was subject to scrutiny by world media, after Castrol released a television film named Ronaldo: Tested to the Limit where he was put to test in several fields, including mental and physical. Conclusions from the movie and doctors in the weeks following claimed that Ronaldo was one of the best athletes in the world, excelling in football and outstanding in almost every other category.  On 24 September, Ronaldo scored a hat-trick (including two penalties) in Real Madrid's 6–2 win over Rayo Vallecano at the Santiago Bernabéu.

 Ronaldo started the season by lifting the Supercopa de España with Real Madrid, scoring two goals in a 4–4 away goals aggregate win against Barcelona . The goal in the first leg made him the first Madrid player in the history of El Clásico to score for the fourth game in a row at the Camp Nou,

Ronaldo was substituted at the 63rd minute by team mate Higuaín , due to a minor thigh injury.  
 On 18 September, Ronaldo scored his first Champions League goal of the season in a 3–2 victory over Manchester City .  
 
 
 
 If Messi is the best on the planet, Ronaldo is the best in the universe. If you are going to give out the Ballon d'Or because a player is the best, give it to Cristiano or Messi. But I ask: if the two are on the same level, is it normal that one wins four and the other one? It is not.

 Real Madrid's failure to win major silverware last season and reports of division in the dressing room had prompted speculation that Ronaldo, whose contract runs until June 2015, might be seeking a move away from the Spanish capital.  
 On 18 August 2013, Ronaldo made his 200th competitive appearance for Real Madrid in a 2–1 home win over Real Betis .  
 On 15 September 2013, after much speculation,  
 In his 100th game in the European competitions against Copenhagen on 2 October 2013, Ronaldo scored a brace as Real Madrid went on to a 4–0 home victory.  
 In a debate at Oxford Union in October 2013, when asked whether FIFA president Sepp Blatter preferred Messi or Ronaldo, Blatter paid tribute to the work ethic of the Argentine before taking a swipe at Ronaldo, claiming "one of them has more expenses for the hairdresser than the other". Real Madrid demanded – and promptly received – a full apology, and the Portuguese issued his own riposte with a mock-salute celebration after scoring a penalty against Sevilla, after Blatter had described him as a "commander" on the pitch.  
 In his 106 away appearances for Real Madrid on 2 November 2013, Ronaldo scored his 100th away goal as he hit a brace in a 3–2 away victory against Rayo Vallecano , averaging 0.94 per game.  
 After his strong form in the 2013–14 campaign by which he had scored 32 goals from 22 matches played for both club and country by the middle of November 2013, including five hat-tricks, Ronaldo suggested that he could be in the "best form of his life".  
 In Real Madrid's first match following the 2013–14 winter break, Ronaldo score a brace in a 3–0 home victory against Celta Vigo , including his 400th career goal in 653 games for club and country. He dedicated his two goals to Eusébio , who had died two days before.  
 
 
 
 Ronaldo is a unique player for all of his talent and his professionalism. He is a player who is extraordinarily consistent.

 Ronaldo also represented Portugal at the 2004 Summer Olympics , scoring a goal in the tournament, although the Portuguese Olympic football squad was eliminated in the first round, finishing bottom of their group with three points.  
 2006 World Cup 
 Ronaldo was the second-highest scorer in the 2006 FIFA World Cup qualification in the European zone with seven goals,  
 During a quarter-final match against England on 1 July 2006, Ronaldo's United teammate Wayne Rooney was sent off for stamping on Portugal defender Ricardo Carvalho . The English media speculated that Ronaldo had influenced referee Horacio Elizondo 's decision by aggressively complaining, after which he was seen in replays winking at the Portuguese bench following Rooney's dismissal. After the match, Ronaldo insisted that Rooney was a friend and that he was not pushing for Rooney to be sent off.  
 The angry reaction from the English press caused Ronaldo to consider leaving United,  
 Ronaldo was booed during Portugal's semi-final defeat to France (0-1),  
 Post-World Cup 
 One day after his 22nd birthday, Ronaldo captained Portugal for the first time in a friendly against Brazil on 6 February 2007.  
 Euro 2008 and 2010 World Cup 
 
 
 
  
Ronaldo was made full-time captain of Portugal after the UEFA Euro 2008 . 
 
 
 Ronaldo scored eight goals in Portugal's UEFA Euro 2008 qualifying campaign,  
 After Portugals's unsuccessful performance in the European Championship, Luiz Felipe Scolari was replaced as Portugal coach with Carlos Queiroz .  
 On 15 June 2010, in Portugal's opening 2010 World Cup match against Côte d'Ivoire , Ronaldo was tackled by right-back Guy Demel , which led to an argument and both being booked. The next day, Portugal contacted FIFA to suggest that Ronaldo's yellow card be rescinded since he was "pulled into" the confrontation after having already moved away from the spot where he was tackled, but the appeal was rejected.  
 Ronaldo was named man of the match in all three of Portugal's group matches against Côte d'Ivoire (0-0), North Korea (7-0) and Brazil (0-0).  The World Cup ended for Portugal with a 1–0 loss against eventual champions Spain in the Round of 16. 
 Euro 2012 
 Ronaldo scored seven goals in Portugal's UEFA Euro 2012 qualifying campaign, including two strikes against Bosnia in the play-offs for the tournament, and finished behind Germany's Miroslav Klose and the Netherlands' Klaas-Jan Huntelaar (not including the play-offs round). Portugal were drawn in Group B with Netherlands , Denmark and Germany , which was widely referred to as the " group of death " of the tournament.  
 
 
 
  
Ronaldo against Germany during their group stage match at UEFA Euro 2012 . 
 
 
 After the opening 0–1 defeat against Germany , Ronaldo was criticised for under performing, showing frustration at his and his team-mates' errors and for walking off into the changing-rooms straight after the match, rather than thanking the crowd with the team. Ronaldo's team-mate, Nani , later defended him, stating that he had left the pitch as he needed to instantly be treated for a possible injury, also adding that he was under excessive pressure, as football is a team sport.  
 During the group stage match between Denmark and Portugal (3-2 win), the Denmark fans chanted Lionel Messi 's name whenever Ronaldo was on the ball. Ronaldo squandered two gilt-edged one-on-one chances, and Ronaldo looked frustrated and tormented throughout.  
 In the final group match between Portugal and the Netherlands , Ronaldo silenced his critics by scored two goals to secure a 2–1 victory for Portugal, allowing the team to advance to the quarterfinals.  
 Ronaldo was further praised for his performance against the Czech Republic in the quarter-finals, where he darted in from behind his marker in the 79th minute and headed a cross from Joao Moutinho , sending Portugal into the semifinals with a 1–0 victory. After scoring the winning goal, he ran to the camera and chanted "para ti" as he had dedicated the goal to his son.  
 
 
 
 In the form he is in, given the chance, he will score. Cristiano wants to bring his team to the final and show why he should be considered the best player in the world.

 In the semi-final against Spain , Ronaldo had several chances, but he sent three shots over the bar.  
 Before and throughout the tournament, Ronaldo was particularly hailed by Argentine great Diego Maradona , who described Ronaldo as "the best player on the planet" and went on to say that " 
 2014 World Cup cycle 
 On 17 October 2012, Ronaldo won his 100th cap for the Portugal national team in a World Cup qualification match against Northern Ireland (1-1) at Porto 's Estádio do Dragão . He became the third youngest European ever to reach that figure in the process, after Germany's Lukas Podolski and Estonia's Kristen Viikmäe .  
 On 14 August 2013, Ronaldo scored his 40th goal for Portugal in a 1–1 friendly draw against the Netherlands.  
 Ronaldo scored eight goals in Portugal's FIFA World Cup 2014 qualifying campaign, including all four of the team's goals in the two-legged play-off against Sweden which ensured Portugal's place at the finals.  
 On 5 March 2014, Ronaldo netted twice in Portugal's 5-1 friendly win over Cameroon to take his tally to 49 goals, thus becoming his country's all-time leading goalscorer.  
 Style of play 
 
 
 
  
Ronaldo, playing for Portugal in 2012, has been compared to four-time FIFA / Ballon d'Or winner Lionel Messi . 
 
 
 Widely regarded as one of the two best players in the world within his generation (the other being Lionel Messi), and as one of the best players to ever play the game,  
 Tactically, Ronaldo plays a powerful attacking role, often drifting from the left wing into the centre when moving off the ball.  
 Cristiano Ronaldo is known for his pace, skill, control and dribbling ability, as well as his flair in beating players during one on one situations. He is able to finish well both inside the area and from distance.  
 Since his arrival at Manchester United, Ronaldo underwent a major body transformation, from a skinny youth to an athletically built adult. His well-built, muscular body type allows him to retain possession of the ball.  
 However, Ronaldo has at times been criticised for his diving when tackled. For which José Mourinho said: "Cristiano is a player who does not have the culture of the swimming pool, he has no culture of simulation, he is a British-trained player, Ferguson trained. In some cases, the simulators are given more protection, and those who are honest are often the losers. I'm not a hypocrite if I say that they (defenders) hit Cristiano very hard, and that the yellow cards do not arrive or are slow in coming."  
 Earlier in his career, Ronaldo had been described as having an "arrogant image" on the field with Ronaldo stating that he had become a "victim", because of how he was portrayed in the media.  
 Ronaldo's direct football style, skill and goalscoring ability have been his most noticeable traits throughout his career, and his overall talent has at times led him to be considered a player who stands out and who can be a match changer.  
 Ronaldo's increasing production led the media to draw comparisons between him and FC Barcelona forward Lionel Messi ,  
 
 
 “ 
 "Maturity brings many things. When I went to see them play against City , some of his decision-making in terms of passing was brilliant. One-touch passing, good crosses. In the six years we had him, you just saw his game grow all the time, and he was a fantastic player. Now you see the complete player. His decision-making, his maturity, his experience, plus all the great skills he has got, they all make him the complete player."

 In January 2014, Spain's high tax laws meant that, reportedly the world's highest-paid player in terms of gross salary, Ronaldo (£11.87 millon-a-year) could only rank second in terms of net pay in World Soccer Magazine ' s list of the footballers with the highest salary, focusing on net basic salaries and do not include bonuses and incentives.  
 In March 2014, Goal ranked Ronaldo first in its list of the world's richest footballers, with an estimated net wealth of €148 million, taking into account all the players' income throughout their careers.
