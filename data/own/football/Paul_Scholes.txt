 Paul Scholes ( /  ˈ  p  ɔː  l   ˈ  s  k  oʊ  l  z  / ; born 16 November 1974) is a retired English footballer who played his entire professional career for Manchester United . 
 Born in Salford , but later moving to Langley , Scholes excelled in both cricket and football whilst at school. He first trained with Manchester United at the age of 14 after being spotted by a scout visiting his school, signing for them as an apprentice on leaving school in 1991, and turning professional in 1993. He made his full debut for United in the 1994–95 season . He went on to play a key part in the club's Treble -winning success in the 1998–99 season , and has won 11 Premier League , three FA Cup and two UEFA Champions League winners medals. 
 Scholes represented the England national team from 1997 to 2004, gaining 66 caps and participating in the 1998 and 2002 World Cups , as well as the UEFA Euro 2000 and Euro 2004 tournaments. 
 Cited by many of his footballing peers as one of the best midfielders of his generation, Scholes has also been criticised for his discliplinary record, amassing over 120 bookings in all competitions during his career and being sent off ten times.  
 Scholes made over 700 appearances for United, the third-highest number of appearances by any player for the club. Scholes announced his retirement from playing on 31 May 2011, receiving a testimonial match , and began his coaching career at the club from the 2011–12 season onward. However, he reversed this decision on 8 January 2012, and went on to play one more season before retiring again in May 2013.

 Early years  
 Scholes was born at Hope Hospital in Salford, Greater Manchester , to parents Stewart and Marina Scholes. The family moved to Langley area of Middleton, Greater Manchester when he was 18 months old where he lived on Bowness Road, and later Talkin Drive.  In his final term at school, he was selected to represent Great Britain National Schools in football. 
 Club career  
 1994–1999  
 Scholes was not a member of Manchester United's 1992 FA Youth Cup -winning squad that included future senior teammates David Beckham , Nicky Butt , Gary Neville and Ryan Giggs , but he was part of the youth team that reached the final in the following season, alongside Phil Neville .  Scholes turned professional on 23 July 1993 and was issued with the number 24 shirt, but did not make his breakthrough into the senior squad until the 1994–95 season, when he made seventeen league appearances and scored five goals. 
 His debut came on 21 September 1994, where he scored both goals in a 2–1 victory over Port Vale in the Football League Cup . His league debut came three days later against Ipswich Town at Portman Road , a game which United lost 3–2 and Scholes scored a consolation goal. He scored two league goals when he came on 10 December when United beat QPR 3–2 at Loftus Road . On 3 January 1995, he got onto the scoresheet at Old Trafford for the first time with the opener in a 2–0 league win over Coventry City . He scored once more that season, in a 3–2 away win over Coventry City on 1 May.  
 Scholes came on as a substitute in the 1995 FA Cup final against Everton , which United lost 1–0. He came close to scoring twice late in the game, only to be foiled by Neville Southall both times. 
 In 1995–96 , after Mark Hughes moved to Chelsea , Scholes had more first-team opportunities, standing in for the suspended Eric Cantona as Andrew Cole 's strike partner for the first two months of the campaign. Scholes (now wearing the number 22 shirt) scored fourteen goals in all competitions as United became the first English team to win the double twice.  He picked up another Premier League winners medal in 1996–97 – in this season he changed his shirt number to 18, which he held for the next 15 years. 
 In the 1996 close season, when United unsuccessfully tried to sign Alan Shearer from Blackburn Rovers , the Ewood Park club reportedly demanded that United should offer Scholes in exchange if any bid for Shearer from United was to be considered. By this stage, Scholes was rated at £5million, and Blackburn had already rejected a part-exchange deal involving £7million-rated Andy Cole .  
 After Roy Keane suffered a knee injury in late September 1997 and was ruled out for the season, Scholes moved to central midfield in the 1997–98 season . However, United finished the season without a major trophy, only the second time in the 1990s that this happened.  
 In 1998–99 , Scholes was a key player in Manchester United's Premier League title, FA Cup , and UEFA Champions League Treble success. He scored one of Manchester United's two goals against Newcastle in the FA Cup final. He also scored an away goal against Internazionale in the Champions League quarter-final . He came on as a substitute in the second leg of the semi final against Italian club Juventus  
 2000–2011  
 In 2001–02 , United completed the signing of Argentine international Juan Sebastián Verón .  However, Scholes failed to adapt to the system and his form suffered. 
 Scholes netted a career-high twenty goals in all competitions in the 2002–03 season, a number that dipped to fourteen the next year. This was despite a career-best four FA Cup goals, in comparison to his total of five FA Cup goals scored in his first nine seasons. He helped Manchester United reach the 2005 FA Cup Final but saw his penalty saved by Jens Lehmann as they lost to Arsenal in a penalty shootout. He was ruled out for the second half of the 2005–06 campaign with blurred vision. The cause of this was initially uncertain, sparking fears that it could end his career. He overcame this problem through the beginning of the year and he appeared in United's final game of the season against Charlton Athletic . Reportedly, Scholes's vision has not completely recovered.

 On 22 October 2006, in the 2–0 Premier League victory over Liverpool, Scholes became the ninth United player to play in five hundred matches, joining Bobby Charlton , Bill Foulkes , and Ryan Giggs .  
 Scholes was dismissed during United's 1–0 away victory over Liverpool on 3 March 2007, for swinging an arm at Xabi Alonso . It marked his first league sending off since April 2005.  A month later, he was sent off in the first leg of United's Champions League quarter final at Roma . 
 On 23 August 2007, he was shortlisted for a place in the English Football Hall of Fame , which ultimately went to Dennis Bergkamp as voted for by Football Focus viewers.

 Scholes suffered knee ligament damage during a training session the night before United's Champions League Group F match with Dynamo Kiev on 23 October 2007, and was out of action until the end of January 2008. He returned as a substitute in United's 3–1 win over Tottenham Hotspur in the fourth round of the FA Cup . On 23 April 2008, Scholes made his 100th Champions League appearance in a 0–0 draw away to Barcelona in the semi-final first leg, and scored the only goal in a 1–0 victory in the second leg that sent United into the final .  
 Scholes was inducted into the English Football Hall of Fame in September 2008  
 On 22 April 2009, he made his 600th appearance for United in a 2–0 win over Portsmouth .  
 On 16 February 2010, Scholes scored his third Champions League goal of the season against Milan in a 3–2 win; it was also United's first away goal against Milan. This gave United their first away win over Milan and also made Scholes the first player to score against both Internazionale and Milan at the San Siro in the Champions League.  
 Scholes began the 2010–11 season strongly, displaying Man of the Match performances against Chelsea in the 2010 Community Shield on 8 August  
 He announced his retirement on 31 May 2011, with immediate effect, and joined the coaching staff at Old Trafford.  
 On 5 August 2011, United held a testimonial match to honour his 17 years of service to the club. The match was played at Old Trafford against New York Cosmos .  United won the match 6–0, with Scholes opening the scoring with a trademark strike from 25 yards. 
 2012–2013  
 On 8 January 2012, Scholes reversed his decision to retire because of the injury crisis in the Manchester United squad and made his return as a substitute during a 3–2 win, against neighbours Manchester City in the FA Cup . His customary number 18 shirt occupied by Ashley Young , Scholes wore the number 22 which he had last worn during the 1995–96 season as he replaced Nani in the 59th minute.  
 On 30 May, Scholes signed a one-year extension with Manchester United, keeping him at the club until summer 2013.  This goal meant that he had scored in his 19th consecutive Premier League season, a feat only surpassed by current team-mate, Ryan Giggs , holding the record with 21 consecutive seasons. 
 On 11 May 2013, Scholes announced that he would make his second and final retirement from football at the end of the season.  Scholes made his 499th and final league appearance on 19 May 2013 against West Bromwich Albion as a substitute. During the game, Scholes earned his 99th Premier League yellow card, the third most all time behind Lee Bowyer , who has collected 102, and Kevin Davies with 101. 
 International career  
 Scholes made his international debut against South Africa in 1997 in a 2–1 friendly win at Old Trafford, and was included in the England squad for the 1998 World Cup . England were grouped with Colombia , Tunisia and Romania . During England's first World Cup group match against Tunisia, Scholes sealed a 2–0 victory with a goal late in the game. 
 His international career continued after England's elimination from the World Cup by Argentina on penalties in the first knock-out round. On 27 March 1999, Scholes managed a hat-trick for England in a game against Poland . In addition, Scholes scored both goals in England's 2–0 win at Hampden Park over Scotland in the Euro 2000 play-off first leg, sealing a 2–1 aggregate win and qualification for the finals tournament. In a qualifier against Sweden that June, Scholes became the first and last England player to be sent off in an international match at the old Wembley Stadium .  
 With the turn of the century, Scholes became a prominent player in England's midfield, becoming a first-choice selection for the 2002 World Cup . However, after the tournament, Scholes saw his opportunities in the national team decline due to Sven-Göran Eriksson playing him out of position on the left midfield to accommodate the pairing of Steven Gerrard and Frank Lampard in central midfield.  
 In July 2006, following Eriksson's departure, there was talk of Scholes making himself available for international duty again under new manager Steve McClaren , but nothing ever came of it.  
 Discipline  
 Over his career, Scholes received 99 yellow and four red cards in the Premier League, making him the third most booked player in Premier League history  
 Style of play  
 Paul Scholes is highly regarded for his technical skills: clean touch, passing range, vision, calmness on the ball even under pressure and rarely relinquishing possession.  
 Sócrates of Brazil said, "(Paul Scholes) good enough to play for Brazil. I love to watch Scholes, to see him pass, the boy with the red hair and the red shirt."  
 In February 2011, Barcelona midfielder Xavi rated Scholes as the best player in his position in the past two decades, stating "A role model. For me, and I really mean this, he's the best central midfielder I've seen in the last 15, 20 years. He's spectacular, he has it all, the last pass, goals, he's strong, he doesn't lose the ball, vision. If he'd been Spanish he might have been rated more highly. Players love him."  
 The one aspect of his game frequently criticised was his tackling, which was recognised as inept by pundits, fans and Scholes himself.  However, Scholes said in an interview after his retirement that the tackles were to get back at players who had fouled him earlier in the game and the infamy surrounding his tackles led to him often being unnecessarily booked. 
 Recently, many including Scholes's national team-mates have said that Scholes is the only English player in the national team that is capable of 'pulling the strings' in midfield, dictating the flow of game where England often have been criticised for being nervous on the ball and giving away possession.  
 Personal life  
 Scholes is asthmatic  with their three children. 
 Scholes' personality off the field has been described as "shy"  Scholes also admitted to FourFourTwo magazine that he feared playing well during the early stages of his career, due to the media attention he would receive by doing so.
