 Rio Gavin Ferdinand (born 7 November 1978) is an English footballer . He plays at centre-back for Manchester United . He played 81 times for the England national football team between 1997 and 2011, and has been a member of three FIFA World Cup squads.  
 Ferdinand began his football career playing for various youth teams , finally settling at West Ham United where he progressed through the youth ranks and made his professional Premier League debut in 1996. He became a fan favourite, winning the 'Hammer of the Year award' the following season. He earned his first senior international cap in a match against Cameroon in 1997, setting a record as the youngest defender to play for England at the time. His achievements and footballing potential attracted Leeds United and he transferred to the club for a record-breaking fee of £18&#160;million. He spent two seasons at the club, becoming the team captain in 2001. 
 He joined Manchester United in July 2002 for around £ 30&#160;million, breaking the transfer fee record once more. As of May 2013, he remains the most expensive English player ever, and the most expensive defender ever transferred.  He won the Premier League, his first major club honour, in a successful first season at the club. In September 2003, he missed a drugs test and was banned from competition for eight months from January until September 2004, causing him to miss half a Premier League season, Manchester United's FA Cup triumph, and the Euro 2004 international competition. Upon his return, he established himself in the Manchester United first team and received plaudits for his performances, featuring in the PFA Team of the Year four times in five years. More club success followed with another Premier League win in the 2006–07 season and a Premier League and UEFA Champions League double the following year. 
 Ferdinand has three children, Lorenz, Tate and Tia, with his wife Rebecca Ellison. He was born into a footballing family: brother Anton Ferdinand is also a centre-back for Bursaspor and former England international striker Les Ferdinand is his cousin, as is Peterborough United midfielder Kane Ferdinand . Off the pitch he is involved with youth charities, film, music, and television including the prank series Rio's World Cup Wind-Ups .

 Early life 
 Formative years and education 
 Ferdinand was born at King's College Hospital in Denmark Hill , Camberwell , London , but grew up in Peckham .  
 Ferdinand had a good upbringing and was a happy child but he also had to learn to live without luxuries in low-income Peckham, a district of London where almost half the population are categorised as poor or borderline poor.  
 
 "I always as a kid wanted to do something different, I'd get bored very easily – even playing football or hanging around with my mates. So travelling away from home, meeting new people. ... I enjoyed it."  
 
 He chose to attend Blackheath Bluecoat School , a school somewhat distant from his house, in order to meet new friends and he settled in well, feeling his confidence growing.  
 Youth team career 
 Ferdinand's superior footballing abilities were evident even as a child: when he was 11 years old a youth coach, David Goodwin, remarked "I'm going to call you Pelé, son, I like the way you play."  
 London team West Ham United was to be his footballing home, however, and he joined their youth system in 1992.

 Originally scouted by Frank Lampard Sr. , Ferdinand progressed through the youth team ranks, earning a professional contract and a place in the first team squad in the process.  
 Leeds United 
 Ferdinand joined Premier League club Leeds United in November 2000 for £ 18&#160;million, then a British transfer record as well as becoming the world's most expensive defender.  
 The following season, in August 2001, he became the club captain after replacing Lucas Radebe and turned in an impressive second campaign, despite Leeds' failure to break into the top four and secure qualification for the competition they had figured in so prominently during the previous season. During the 2002 FIFA World Cup , rumours began circulating that the club were in dire financial trouble and that new manager Terry Venables would be forced to part with his star defender for a substantial amount of cash. Later that summer after Ferdinand's impressive World Cup for England, Leeds accepted a bid of £29.1&#160;million due to their perilous financial position.

Ferdinand for Manchester United 
 
 
 On 22 July 2002, Ferdinand joined fellow Premier League side Manchester United on a five-year deal to become the most expensive British footballer in history at the time and the world's most expensive defender for a second time, a title he had lost in 2001 to Lilian Thuram .  This included agents' fees, with Leeds receiving just under £30&#160;million. Ferdinand went on to win the Premier League title with Manchester United in his first season at the club. He has also collected a winner's medal in the 2006 League Cup , with runners-up medals in the 2003 League Cup and the 2005 FA Cup . 
 In September 2003, he failed to attend a drug test scheduled to take place at United's Carrington training ground. Ferdinand had left after training to go shopping, only to remember and attempt to return, only to be told it was too late. He did undergo testing the following day and passed, and also offered to have a hair follicle test, which would provide results for the previous six months, but the FA turned down the offer.  
 On 14 December 2005, in a game against Wigan Athletic , Ferdinand scored his first goal for United, en route to a 4–0 victory.  
 Following impressive and consistent performances in the league, Rio Ferdinand was named in the 2006–07 PFA Premiership Team of the Season , alongside seven of his Manchester United team-mates.

 Ferdinand started the 2007–08 season well, he was part of a United defence that managed to keep six clean sheets in a row in the Premier League, before conceding an early goal to Aston Villa at Villa Park on 20 October 2007.  
 After United's 2–1 loss to Chelsea in the Premier League in April 2008 Ferdinand, angry at the defeat, swore at Chelsea stewards and tried to kick a wall in the tunnel, but instead kicked a female steward, Tracy Wray. Ferdinand claimed to have merely brushed her with his foot.

 It was announced on 16 April 2008 that, along with Michael Carrick and Wes Brown , Ferdinand had agreed to sign a new five-year contract, worth around £130,000 a week, which would keep him with United until 2013. The contract was finally signed on 15 May 2008.  He accepted the trophy together with Ryan Giggs , as Giggs was the on field captain for most of the matches during that season during Gary Neville 's absence due to injury. 
 In an interview with BBC Radio 5 Live he criticised FIFA's approach to tackling racism in football, stating that not enough was being done to punish those guilty of homophobic or racist abuse at matches. Regarding taunts aimed at Emile Heskey in England's 4–1 victory against Croatia in Zagreb , Ferdinand remarked: 
 
 "Croatia were fined a few thousand quid. What's that going to do? That is not going to stop people shouting racist or homophobic abuse...If things like this keep happening you have to take points off them. Then the punters will realise the team is going to be punished."  
 
 Ferdinand had an injury plagued 2009–10 season, a number of back and knee injuries kept him on the sidelines for months. He returned to action on 28 January 2010, but was banned for four games after being found guilty of violent conduct for elbowing Hull City 's Craig Fagan .  
 Due to a knee injury he suffered in the summer of 2010, which ruled him out of the World Cup for England, he missed all of pre-season, the Community Shield and the first four games of the 2010–11 Premier League season. He returned to first-team football in the opening game of the Champions League group stage against Rangers on 14 September. He captained the side and played the full 90 minutes in a goalless draw. 
 Ferdinand started the season opening game in August 2011, the 2011 FA Community Shield , where United found themselves 2–0 down at half time to city rivals Manchester City . Ferdinand was taken off after 45 minutes along with defensive partner Nemanja Vidić and replaced by Jonny Evans and Phil Jones respectively. United went on to win the game 3–2 and Ferdinand claimed his fourth Community Shield medal of his career. Ferdinand started in the opening Premier League match of the season at West Bromwich Albion , a game United won 2–1, but he went off with a hamstring injury after 75 minutes. After the match Alex Ferguson confirmed that Ferdinand would be out for six weeks. Ferdinand however recovered much quicker than initially diagnosed and returned to take a place on the bench two weeks later at Old Trafford in United's 8–2 demolition of Arsenal , although he did not play a part in the game.  Ferdinand made his return to competitive action in a 1–1 draw against Stoke City at the Britannia Stadium . 
 On 9 December 2012, Ferdinand was struck and injured by a coin thrown from the home crowd during United's 3–2 derby victory away from home against Manchester City.  
 On 5 March 2013, Ferdinand, unhappy with the referee Cüneyt Çakır 's decision to send off Nani during a 2–1 Champions League defeat to Real Madrid at Old Trafford, clapped sarcastically in the referee's face after the game. He escaped any punishment from UEFA for the incident.  
 On 12 May 2013, Ferdinand scored the winner and final goal of the Sir Alex Ferguson era at Old Trafford in a 2-1 victory over Swansea City . After a corner was missed by everyone, the ball found its way to Ferdinand at the back post and he smashed home on the volley to seal the win. 
 On 23 May 2013, it was announced that Ferdinand had secured a new 1 year contract that will see him stay with the club until at least the end of the 2013/2014 season.  
 International career 
 
 
 
  
Ferdinand with the England national team in 2009 
 
 
 Ferdinand was capped 81 times  Although Ferdinand has been named in the last four England World Cup squads (albeit without playing in 1998 and missing 2010 through injury), he has never been to a European Championship due to a ban for missing a drugs test and due to England's failure to qualify for UEFA Euro 2008 . 
 Ferdinand has scored three goals for England, the first in the 2002 World Cup second round match against Denmark (although some sources credit this goal as a Thomas Sørensen own goal  ). The second was a near post strike that beat the Russian goalkeeper Vyacheslav Malafeev in England's Euro 2008 qualifier against Russia on 12 September 2007 at Wembley Stadium. The third on 11 October 2008 in a 2010 FIFA World Cup qualifying match at home to Kazakhstan . England won 5–1. 
 At the age of 19 years and 8 days, Ferdinand earned his first full England cap as a substitute in a friendly against Cameroon on 15 November 1997, making him the youngest defender to play for England at the time (a record broken in 2006 by Micah Richards ). Ferdinand would have made an even earlier debut in September had he not been charged with drink-driving in the build up to England's 1998 World Cup qualifier against Moldova . Ferdinand was named in the squad for this game and was a likely starter; however, the public mourning for Princess Diana – whose chauffeur had been suspected of drink-driving – left Glenn Hoddle with little choice but to drop the talented teenager from the squad. After an impressive 1997–98 season he was selected for the 1998 World Cup squad as a back-up defender. However, he was not selected in Kevin Keegan 's 22-man squad for the 2000 European Championships  
 After his £18m move to Leeds United, Ferdinand was named in the starting line-up by caretaker manager Peter Taylor in a friendly match against Italy  and quickly established himself as a first-choice player under Sven-Göran Eriksson . He was selected as one of England's two first-choice centre-backs at the 2002 and 2006 World Cups , wearing the number 5 shirt. John Terry (who he would later partner for many years in central defence) replaced Ferdinand in the England side throughout his eight-month ban until his return on 9 October 2004 in their World Cup qualifier against Wales . Ferdinand has played ten World Cup finals matches for England, recording clean sheets against Argentina , Nigeria and Denmark in 2002, and Paraguay , Trinidad &amp; Tobago , Ecuador and Portugal in 2006. 
 On 25 March 2008 it was announced that Ferdinand would wear the captain's armband for Fabio Capello 's second game in charge of the national team,  ahead of John Terry , Steven Gerrard or David Beckham , who some believed would be named captain to mark his 100th cap for his country. An FA statement suggested that the decision to name Ferdinand as captain was part of Capello's plans of rotating the captaincy before naming an official captain for September's World Cup qualifiers . On 19 August, however, Ferdinand lost out to Terry in retaining the captain's armband but was named vice-captain by Fabio Capello. 
 A mistake in the match between England and Ukraine in Dnipropetrovsk on 10 October 2009 which led to the sending off of Robert Green led some to question his inclusion in the squad. A lack of match practice for his club and a series of errors such as he suffered in his early days as a footballer led to criticism of his inclusion from several corners.  
 On 5 February 2010, Ferdinand replaced John Terry as captain of England.  
 Although back and groin injury problems forced him to miss much of the 2009–10 domestic season , Ferdinand was selected to captain England at the 2010 World Cup . However, he suffered a knee ligament injury during the team's first training session in South Africa on 4 June and was subsequently ruled out of the tournament.  
 Ferdinand was left out of Roy Hodgson 's squad for Euro 2012 , leading to strong speculation this was to avoid potential conflict with John Terry, who was included in the squad, due to Terry's upcoming trial for racially abusing Ferdinand's brother Anton .  
 On 3 October 2012, The Daily Mirror reported that Roy Hodgson had revealed to fellow passengers on the London Underground that Ferdinand would no longer be considered for England duty, despite the retirement of John Terry.  
 On 14 March 2013, Ferdinand was recalled to the England squad for the first time under Hodgson for England's 2014 World Cup qualifiers against San Marino and Montenegro , though subsequently Ferdinand pulled out of the squad on 18 March due to 'fitness concerns'. Ferdinand said he was "gutted" at having to withdraw but said it was the "right decision". The England manager Roy Hodgson assured Ferdinand he still has an international future despite the withdrawal.  
 In May 2013, Ferdinand announced his retirement from international football, saying that "it's the right time to make room for young players and focus on the club career".

 Personal life 
 
 
 
  
Ferdinand in 2004 
 
 
 Ferdinand grew up in the Friary council estate, Peckham .  
 Ferdinand detailed his upbringing and outlook in a 2007 book, Rio: My Story . Ferdinand is one of a small group of sportsmen to receive over £1&#160;million as an advance for an autobiography. Ferdinand's experiences growing up in Peckham inspired him to set up the Rio Ferdinand Live the Dream Foundation in December 2009, with the aim to nurture and develop young people from deprived communities seeking careers in sports and entertainment. The foundation has received support from the UK Government and industry.  
 Television, film and music 
 The Duran Duran song " Rio " has been used in football chants both for and against Ferdinand; in 2002, fan Simon Le Bon (Duran Duran's lead singer) promised to re-record one of the football chants if the team won.  
 In 2005, Ferdinand, along with an old school friend, created the record label White Chalk Music.  
 In June 2006, on the day of the England national team's opening World Cup group match against Paraguay , Ferdinand made his début appearance as a television presenter. Hosting Rio's World Cup Wind-Ups , which was produced by his long-time business partner Chris Nathaniel of NVA Entertainment , the England defender found himself in a Jeremy Beadle -style role, playing tricks on his fellow England World Cup squad members including Wayne Rooney , David Beckham and Gary Neville .  
 He made his first foray into the world of cinema in late 2008, financing and becoming an executive producer of Alex de Rakoff 's film Dead Man Running . The film features Danny Dyer and 50 Cent in a gangster-themed plot. Ferdinand will share production credits with England team-mate Ashley Cole .  
 In 2008. Ferdinand filmed a documentary about Peckham, aiming to persuade youngsters away from a life of crime.  
 On 16 January 2009, it was announced that he would working with publishing company Made Up Media to launch a digital magazine.  
 Controversies 
 In 2000, Ferdinand briefly appeared in a sexually explicit video filmed at the Ayia Napa resort in Cyprus along with fellow English footballers Kieron Dyer and Frank Lampard . Channel 4 aired a brief clip as part of their 2004 documentary Sex, Footballers and Videotape , claiming it was used to "remind the viewer that this is based on real life".  
 In 2002, during the rape trial of their acquaintance Martin King, Ferdinand and former Leeds colleague Michael Duberry denied allegations that Duberry had molested the woman and Ferdinand had threatened her in the Leeds nightclub Hi-Fi on the night of 22 January, as well as further allegations of scuffling and drunkenness. Both men were interviewed by the police but the Crown Prosecution Service announced in April 2003 that they would not face charges.  
 During a radio interview on The Chris Moyles Show in October 2006, Ferdinand attracted two listener complaints and criticism from gay rights campaigner Peter Tatchell when he called Moyles a faggot , followed by "I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I'm not homophobic ", after Moyles had jokingly suggested he was homosexual . BBC Radio 1 later dismissed the exchange as banter , while Tatchell said "since  
 In the wake of a court case involving John Terry and Rio's brother Anton , in which Terry was found not guilty of racial abuse, Rio Ferdinand sparked media controversy by expressing amusement at the comments of a Twitter user who referred to Ashley Cole , who had testified in Terry's favour, as a "choc ice", a slang term which is commonly understood to mean " black on the outside, white on the inside ". Ferdinand deleted the tweet shortly afterwards and denied choc ice is a racist term, adding, "And if I want to laugh at something someone tweets....I will! Hahahahaha! Now stop getting ya knickers in a twist!"  
 Driving bans 
 In September 1997, Ferdinand was convicted of drink-driving and given a one-year driving ban. He had been breathalysed after driving on the morning after a night out, and was found to be one point over the limit.  
 In March 2003, Ferdinand was given another six month ban from driving, and fined £2,500 and six penalty points for driving at an average of 92&#160;mph (148&#160;km/h) along the M1 .  
 In September 2012 Ferdinand was given a six-month ban from driving after being caught speeding three times in six weeks on the same road. Ferdinand already had three points on his licence after twice being caught speeding in the same area in January.
