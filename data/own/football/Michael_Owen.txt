 Michael James Owen  /  ˈ  oʊ  .  ɨ  n  / (born 14 December 1979) is an English former footballer who played as a striker for Liverpool , Real Madrid , Newcastle United , Manchester United and Stoke City as well as the England national team . He is a regular pundit on BT Sport football coverage and sometimes appears on BBC's Match of the Day as a pundit. 
 The son of former footballer Terry Owen , Owen was born in Chester and began his senior career at Liverpool in 1996. He progressed through the Liverpool youth team and scored on his debut in May 1997. In his first full season in the Premier League he finished as joint top scorer with 18 goals. He repeated this the following year and was Liverpool's top goal scorer from 1997–2004 and gained his name as a proven goal scorer, despite a recurring hamstring injury. In 2001 , Liverpool won a cup treble of the UEFA Cup , FA Cup and Football League Cup , and Owen was the recipient of the Ballon d'Or . He went on to score 118 goals in 216 appearances in the Premier League for Liverpool, and 158 goals in 297 total appearances. Regarded as one of the greatest Liverpool players, Owen came 14th in the " 100 Players Who Shook The Kop " – an official Liverpool fan poll.  
 Owen moved to Real Madrid for £8&#160;million in mid-2004; he was frequently used as a substitute . He scored 13 goals in La Liga before returning to England the following season where he joined Newcastle United for £16&#160;million. After a promising start to the 2005–06 season, injuries largely ruled him out over the next 18 months. After his return he became team captain and was the team's top scorer for the 2007–08 season. Newcastle were relegated in the 2008–09 season and Owen moved to Manchester United as a free agent . He spent three years at Old Trafford before joining Stoke City in September 2012. Owen is one of seven players to have scored 150 or more goals in the Premier League .  On 19 March 2013, Owen announced his retirement from playing at the end of the 2012–13 season . 
 Internationally, Owen first played for the senior England team in 1998, becoming England's youngest player and youngest goalscorer at the time. His performance at the 1998 FIFA World Cup brought him to national and international prominence and he went on to score in UEFA Euro 2000 , the 2002 FIFA World Cup and UEFA Euro 2004 . He is the only player to have scored in four major tournaments for England. He played at the 2006 FIFA World Cup but suffered an injury which took him a year to recover from. Occasionally playing as captain, he is England's tenth most-capped player and has scored a national record of 26 competitive goals, with 40 in total from 89 appearances, most recently in 2008.  
 Owen's long injury absence after the 2006 World Cup resulted in a dispute between FIFA , The Football Association and Newcastle United, and eventually resulted in an unprecedented £10m compensation award to Newcastle, and brought changes to the compensation arrangements between club and country regarding injuries sustained by contracted club players while on international duty.

 Early life  
 Owen was born in Chester , Cheshire , the fourth child of Jeanette and Terry Owen .  
 At eight, Owen was selected for the Deeside Area Primary School's Under-11 team. At nine he was captain and at ten he had smashed Ian Rush 's twenty-year record for the same team by scoring a record breaking 97 goals in a single season, improving on Rush's record by 25 goals.  
 Club career  
 Liverpool

 At age 12, when Owen started attending secondary school, he became eligible to sign a schoolboy contract with a club. The first major club to spot him playing for Deeside was Liverpool . Brian Kidd came down from Manchester United and there was also interest from Chelsea and Arsenal . But Steve Heighway , the Liverpool youth development officer, wrote to Owen personally. Terry Owen stated: " 
 In the 1995–96 season, Owen played for Liverpool's youth team even though he was still at Lilleshall. Most of the players were 18, but Owen was only 16.  
 1996–2000  
 Owen celebrated his seventeenth birthday by signing a professional contract with Liverpool. He was handed a place in Roy Evans ' senior squad with Steve Heighway stating that: " 
 On 6 May 1997, Owen scored on his Liverpool debut against Wimbledon at Selhurst Park .  
 Owen replaced the injured Robbie Fowler as Liverpool's first choice striker in 1997–98 . He won the Premier League Golden Boot and was awarded the PFA Young Player of the Year award. Owen also finished in third place in the PFA Player of the Year voting behind Dennis Bergkamp and Tony Adams .  Owen was runners-up to Zinedine Zidane in the World Player of the Year award. He finished in fourth position in the FIFA World Player of the Year and European Player of the Year international awards. 
 Owen retained the Premier League Golden Boot in 1998–99 despite incurring a hamstring injury against Leeds United that prematurely brought his season to an end on 12 April. With his pace identified as his greatest strength, Liverpool's game had revolved around feeding him with through passes and long balls. Owen constantly moved from static positions to full speed in a matter of split seconds. ESPN wrote: "It  
 Owen returned to action after almost five months of layoff during the 1999–2000 season.  
 2000–2004  
 Owen helped Liverpool to a Treble in 2000–01 .  
 Liverpool and Owen challenged for the league championship during the 2001–02 season .  
 Real Madrid president, Florentino Pérez , started as early as in March 2002 to pursue Owen.  
 Owen continued with strong performances in the 2002–03 season which saw Liverpool top the league table and remain unbeaten for several months.  
 Liverpool's failure to qualify for the Champions League led to speculation about Owen's long-term future.  
 Houllier moved to re-shape the Liverpool squad in 2003 to reassure Owen.  
 After a shaky start to the 2003–04 season,  
 Following Gérard Houllier 's sacking as Liverpool manager, speculation about Owen's departure from the club began. During the first few Champions League games at the start of the 2004–05 season , Owen sat on the bench to avoid being cup-tied for the Champions League, something that would have meant he would be unable to play in European competitions for any other club that season. Since 1998 Owen had been Liverpool's top scorer every season until he left the club.  
 Real Madrid

 Following their successful bid, Owen was presented with the number 11 shirt by Real Madrid . Owen joined the club during its Galácticos era, and played alongside Ronaldo , Raúl , Luís Figo , Zinedine Zidane and his England teammate David Beckham . 
 Owen had a slow start to his Madrid career. He was often confined to the bench and drew criticism from fans and the Spanish press for his lack of form. A successful return to action with the England squad in October 2004 seemed to revive his morale, however, and in the first following match, he scored his first goal for the club, the winner in a 1–0 Champions League victory over Dynamo Kyiv .  The scoring spree continued, as he found the back of the net in three of the next four matches to make it five goals in seven successive matches. 
 On 10 April 2005, Owen scored Real Madrid's fourth goal in a 4–2 El Clásico win over FC Barcelona at the Estadio Santiago Bernabéu .  
 Owen ended the 2004–05 season with thirteen goals in the Primera División , with the season's highest ratio of goals scored to number of minutes played. Following Madrid's signing of two high-profile Brazilian forwards, Robinho and Júlio Baptista in the summer of 2005, the speculation arose that Owen would return to the Premier League. During his time at Real Madrid, Owen scored 18 goals from 41 games, 15 of which were starts.  
 Newcastle United  
 On 24 August 2005, Newcastle United announced that they had agreed a club record fee  It was also a "perfect hat trick ", with one goal scored with each of his left foot, right foot, and head. 
 On 31 December 2005, Owen broke a metatarsal bone in his foot in a match against Tottenham Hotspur . He underwent surgery to place a pin in the bone, to help speed the healing process. He was expected to be out of action until late March,  He underwent a further X-ray and made himself unavailable for Newcastle's final game of the season. 
 A damaged anterior cruciate ligament in his right knee, sustained in the first minute of the group match against Sweden at the 2006 World Cup, kept Owen out of regular football for nearly a year, until April 2007. The seriousness of Owen's injury at the World Cup inflamed the so-called 'club-versus-country' row in England, centring on the liability of the world governing body FIFA and The Football Association for the cost of injuries to players incurred while on international duty.  
 Newcastle's compensation claim included the £10m cost of buying Owen's replacement, Obafemi Martins , £6.2m towards Owen's salary costs while injured, the possibility of long-term damage to Owen's fitness and ability, the loss of league position and cup competition progress, depreciation of Owen's four-year contract, and the cost of medical treatment for Owen.  
 
 
 
  
Owen training with Newcastle in 2007 
 
 
 Owen began light training on 12 February 2007, when pictures on the club's official website highlighted Owen running and carrying out minor exercises.  
 On 9 May 2007, Newcastle chairman Freddy Shepherd reacted angrily to reports that Owen could move on to another club at the end of the 2006–07 season , due to a release clause in his contract. A report in The Times newspaper suggested Owen could be available for less than £10million and could be a target for the likes of Chelsea, Manchester United, Liverpool and Arsenal. Despite these reports, Shepherd warned Owen "to show some loyalty" and warned him that "none of the big four clubs want him."  
 On 17 July 2007, he scored for Newcastle in a pre-season friendly against Hartlepool United .  
 In late September 2007, after an encouraging start to the season playing for both Newcastle United and for England, it was reported that he would urgently require an operation for a double hernia and would likely be out of action for at least a month.  
 In November 2007, Owen suffered a thigh strain whilst on international duty, ruling him out for six weeks. This reignited the 'club or country' row, with then Newcastle manager Sam Allardyce voicing his disappointment that Owen was risked in a low-key friendly game against Austria.  
 After over three months without a goal, Owen scored the first goal of the second Kevin Keegan era in a 4–1 FA Cup third round replay win over Stoke City on 16 January 2008, although Keegan was only a spectator in the stands for this game. Owen was awarded the captaincy by Keegan on 19 January 2008. He scored his first league goal of 2008 on 3 February. Owen's goal in the 2–0 defeat of Fulham on 22 March 2008, which marked Newcastle's first win under Kevin Keegan's second spell as manager, also marked the first time in his Newcastle career that Owen had scored more goals for Newcastle than against them.  By 5 April 2008, after his and the team's early season poor form, Owen had scored six goals in the previous six matches, with Newcastle registering four wins and two draws, lifting Newcastle into mid-table after earlier relegation fears. In the final game of the season, Owen scored in a 3–1 loss at Everton , finishing with 11 goals in total, putting him in equal 13th position for Premier League goals for the 2007–2008 season. 
 Owen missed all of the pre-season matches and training of the 2008–09 season due to a bout of mumps , which also kept him out of the international friendlies with the USA and Trinidad &amp; Tobago in May 2008. He also suffered a calf strain during the summer months which kept him out of the opening game of the season against Manchester United at Old Trafford , a game which Newcastle drew 1–1. He made his return in the second game of the season against Bolton Wanderers on 23 August 2008, coming on in the 53rd minute for the injured Obafemi Martins . He scored the winning header in the 71st minute with the game finishing 1–0. Three days later he was named on the bench in a League Cup match away to Coventry City , he came on as a substitute and scored the winner in extra time in a 2–3 victory. In the 2008–2009 season he featured more consistently than in prior seasons, scoring four goals in twelve league appearances. 
 Under the transfer rules, with the 2008–09 season being the final year of his contract with Newcastle, Owen would have been allowed to sign a pre-contract agreement with other clubs during in January. On 22 December 2008, Owen rejected a new contract offer from Newcastle, but stated that he would not be seeking a move in the January transfer window and instead intended to postpone talks over his contract situation until the end of the season.  
 After a disastrous season in general for the club, which culminated in Owen's former Newcastle and England team mate Alan Shearer being brought in as a temporary manager for the final 8 games of the season, on the final day of the season on 24 May 2009, Newcastle were relegated from the Premier League for the first time in 15 years. On 14 June it was reported that Owen's management company Wasserman Media Group had sent out a 34-page brochure advertising Owen to several potential clubs.

 On 3 July 2009, it was announced that Owen had signed a two-year deal with Premier League champions, Manchester United .  
 Owen scored his first goal for United on his debut, scoring an 84th-minute winner after coming on as a substitute in a pre-season friendly against a Malaysian XI;  
 On 27 October, Owen notched a goal in the 2–0 away win against Barnsley to qualify United past the fourth round of the league cup. On 3 November, Owen scored his first Champions League goal for Manchester United, as he grabbed United's first in the 3–3 draw against CSKA Moscow .  
 2010–11  
 Owen netted his first goal for United back from injury in a 7–1 pre-season victory against a League of Ireland XI on 4 August 2010 at the newly built Aviva Stadium .  On 25 February, United manager Alex Ferguson said that Owen was a key part of his squad for the rest of the season. However, he suffered a groin injury and missed his team's next four games. His return match was on 19 March when he returned to the bench for United's game against Bolton.

 By the time of United's penultimate game of the season, he had reached the number of league appearances required for a title winner's medal – his first in 15 seasons as a professional.  
 He was an unused substitute in Man United's uninspiring 2011 Champions League Final defeat to FC Barcelona marking the end of his season. He signed a one-year extension to his contract on 1 June 2011.  
 2011–12  
 Owen started his first game of the season in the third round of the League Cup against Leeds United . He scored two goals in the first half, helping United to progress to the fourth round with a 3–0 win. His first goal came after he advanced to the box and scuffed a shot into the corner of the net. The second goal came on the half-hour mark, when he met Mame Biram Diouf 's cross with instant control, before firing a right foot shot into the top.  
 Owen started in United's home UEFA Champions League group stage match against Oţelul Galaţi on 2 November, however he was substituted early in the first half when he pulled up with a thigh injury; this was he last appearance for the team. In February 2012, Owen started light training with the Manchester United squad. From April 2012, Owen started full training but was not yet ready for first team games. On 13 May 2012, Michael Owen was named as a substitute against Sunderland in United's final fixture. 
 On 17 May 2012, Owen announced on Twitter that Manchester United would not be offering him a new deal, ending his three-year association with the club. 
 Stoke City

 On 4 September 2012, Owen joined Stoke City on a one-year contract.  
 International career  
 Owen was capped 89 times for England and scored 40 goals. He is fourth in the list of all-time top scorers for the England team , behind Bobby Charlton (49 goals), Gary Lineker (48) and Jimmy Greaves (44). He is also England's second highest goalscorer in competitive international matches, behind Wayne Rooney .  His 89 caps also place him in the top 10 of England's most capped players . 
 He played for England at the 1998 , 2002 and 2006 FIFA World Cups and the 2000 and 2004 UEFA European Championships . He scored goals in all but one of these tournaments, making him the only player ever to have scored in four major tournaments for England.  He is one of only eleven England players to have appeared in three World Cups . 
 Emergence  
 Owen had a highly successful record at Youth level, playing for the England under-20 team at the 1997 FIFA World Youth Championship and scoring three goals in four games. He played once for the England under-21 team, scoring in a win over Greece under-21 at Carrow Road . 
 He made his debut for the England senior team in a 2–0 friendly loss to Chile on 11 February 1998. This made Owen the youngest player to represent England in the 20th century at 18 years and 59 days of age.  
 Owen's youthful enthusiasm, pace and talent made him a popular player across the country,  until his record was surpassed by Wayne Rooney in 2003. 
 
 
 
 "He is in the top four of our greatest finishers, along with Jimmy Greaves , Gary Lineker and Alan Shearer . Some might say he is at the top of that list. He was a baby-faced assassin. His finishing was amazing for a young man." 
 
 
 Glenn Hoddle  
 
 1998 World Cup  
 Owen was selected for the World Cup squad by manager Glenn Hoddle , becoming England's youngest ever player at a World Cup when he came on as a substitute in the opening match against Tunisia . In the following match, a 2–1 defeat to Romania , Owen again appeared as a substitute . His equalising goal made him England's youngest ever goalscorer in the tournament at the age of 18 years and 190 days. In stoppage time , he hit the post with a long range shot, almost salvaging a point from the game.  Because of his impact against Romania, Hoddle selected Owen in the starting line-up for England's decisive group match against Colombia . England won the match and Owen retained his place for the second round match against Argentina . 
 After Argentina had taken an sixth minute lead, Owen was fouled in the penalty area by Roberto Ayala and Alan Shearer equalised with the penalty kick . In the 16th minute, Owen gave England a 2–1 lead with a sensational individual goal. After beating defenders Ayala and José Chamot he struck the ball past goalkeeper Carlos Roa from just outside the penalty box. In 2013, the goal was voted as the third greatest in England's history.  
 Euro 2000  
 Owen started the UEFA Euro 2000 qualifying phase as a regular in the England starting line-up. However, injury problems meant he missed much of the campaign as England struggled, with Hoddle being replaced by Kevin Keegan . On 4 September 1999, he scored his first goal at Wembley Stadium in a 6–0 win over Luxembourg .  
 At the finals , Owen scored once in three matches, as England were knocked out at the group stage . 
 2002 World Cup  
 After Alan Shearer 's retirement, Owen took over as England's senior striker  
 
 
 
 "You know that if he is on the pitch, there is always the chance to win until the last second of the game. There are so many good memories of Michael and my relationship with him as coach, but it must be scoring three goals against Germany away. I never thought about that, but I wonder now how many players have scored three goals in Germany away? That can't be many." 
 
 
 Sven-Göran Eriksson  
 
 In April 2002, he was named as England's captain for a friendly match against Paraguay in place of the injured regular captain David Beckham . Owen was the youngest England captain since Bobby Moore in 1963,  and in the following few seasons regularly deputised for Beckham as Eriksson's vice-captain. 
 At the 2002 World Cup finals , Owen failed to score during the group stage . However, he was fouled for England's match winning penalty kick in the 1–0 win over Argentina . Owen scored in England's second round match against Denmark and then gave England an early lead in the 2–1 quarter-final defeat against Brazil . 
 Euro 2004  
 Owen scored five times in qualification for Euro 2004 . 
 At the tournament proper, Owen again failed to score during the group stage . He then scored in the third minute of the quarter-final with Portugal , becoming the first England player to score in four consecutive major tournaments.  England went on to lose on penalties after a 2–2 draw. 
 2006 World Cup  
 In qualification for the 2006 World Cup , Owen scored five goals. 
 In May 2005, he scored his second international hat-trick in a friendly match against Colombia at Giants Stadium .  
 Owen made his debut for the England B-team in a friendly against Belarus on 25 May 2006, as part of his return to match fitness ahead of the 2006 FIFA World Cup . He captained England B in this game, playing for 61&#160;minutes before being substituted.  
 Owen started England's first two games of the 2006 World Cup, against Paraguay and Trinidad and Tobago , but did not manage to score. After playing only 51 seconds of his third appearance of the tournament, and 80th cap, in the final group game against Sweden , Owen badly twisted his right knee and was forced to leave the match on a stretcher.  
 Final appearances  
 Owen underwent successful reconstruction surgery, carried out by Dr. Richard Steadman , on 6 September 2006.  
 On 12 September 2007, Owen scored twice for England in a 3–0 win over Russia , becoming the first player to score international goals at both the old and new Wembley Stadiums .  
 After England failed to qualify for Euro 2008 , manager Steve McClaren was replaced by Fabio Capello . Owen made only one appearance under Capello, as a substitute in a friendly against France in March 2008.

 Personal life  
 Owen met English-born Louise Bonsall at primary school in 1984.  so opted to marry in a registry office in informal clothing and have a lavish reception the next day in the grounds of their home. 
 Their daughter, Gemma Rose, was born on 1 May 2003.  
 After Owen returned to the UK to play for Newcastle United, he travelled to a nearby BAE facility on a daily basis in order to fly, by helicopter , to train with his club. However, there is now a helipad installed within the grounds of the house to accommodate Owen's Eurocopter Dauphin , with which he both travels and is training to become a pilot.  
 Owen also bought an entire street for his extended family in Ewloe , which is in an area close to where he used to live.  
 In 2004, Owen's sister Karen was assaulted by two youths, who attempted to kidnap her. When she revealed that she was pregnant, they fled.  
 Owen owns several cars and a helicopter and enjoys horse racing and gambling. He owns many race horses, trained by Tom Dascombe .  
 Owen starred in a series of adverts that charted his life, and rise to fame.  
 Owen also starred as himself in the cult Children's classic TV show Hero to Zero . In the programme, Owen would emerge from a full size poster of himself in Charlie Brice's room to offer advice in times of crisis.  
 Owen had indicated that he would like to become involved with Chester F.C. in some capacity when he retires, as it was his local team growing up and his father played for the old Chester side which went out of business in March 2010 and was reformed at a lower level.  
 Owen also announced that he would be involved with a new selection of sport channels from BT Sport as a football commentator after his retirement.
