 Rutgerus Johannes Martinus "Ruud" van Nistelrooy ( Dutch pronunciation:&#160;  born 1 July 1976) is a retired Dutch footballer . He is the fourth-highest goalscorer in Champions League history with 56 goals. He is a three-time Champions League top scorer, as well as a top scorer in three different European domestic leagues. 
 Van Nistelrooy began his career with Den Bosch , before moving onto Heerenveen , eventually making a name for himself at PSV Eindhoven where he won two Dutch leagues . His goalscoring record at PSV attracted attention from Manchester United ; a deal was in place in the summer of 2000, but because of injury problems his move was secured a year later for a then British record fee of £19&#160;million. His time at United was successful, winning the Premier League , FA Cup , Football League Cup and FA Community Shield , along with winning the Sir Matt Busby Player of the Year twice. Van Nistelrooy hit 150 goals in just 219 games for United, as well as being their all time European record goalscorer, but fell out of favour towards the end of his tenure. Real Madrid then secured his services in 2006. Although an injury blighted the end of his days with Madrid, he did win La Liga twice and the Supercopa de España before signing for Hamburger SV during the January transfer window in 2010. After a season-and-a-half with Hamburg, he moved back to Spain with Málaga in the summer of 2011. His retirement from football was announced on 14 May 2012.

 Club career  
 Early career  
 Born in Oss , North Brabant , Van Nistelrooy started his professional career in 1993 with Dutch second division side Den Bosch , where he was converted from a central midfielder to centre forward after playing part-time for Nooit Gedacht and Margriet. After netting 12 goals in 31 games in the 1996–97 campaign, he transferred for € 360,000 to Heerenveen the next year, and scored 13 goals in 31 matches in his only season with the club. He was then signed by PSV Eindhoven the next season for €6.3&#160;million, a then-record transfer sum between two Dutch teams. 
 He scored 31 goals in 34 matches, the highest season total in the Eredivisie and second-highest in Europe overall, in addition to scoring all three of PSV's goals in a Champions League match against HJK Helsinki on 25 November 1998. Van Nistelrooy capped off the year by winning the Dutch Player of the Year award. The following season , he won his second Eredivisie scoring title with 29 goals. According to a 2001 interview with The Telegraph , Manchester United coach Sir Alex Ferguson said that his son Darren , who was at tryouts for Eredivisie rival Heerenveen at the time, begged his father, "You've got to sign Van Nistelrooy right away, he's fantastic. We've been watching him."  
 Van Nistelrooy looked set to complete an £ 18.5&#160;million transfer to Manchester United in the summer of 2000. A press conference had been called to confirm Van Nistelrooy's arrival, but instead this was used to announce that the transfer had been delayed over concerns about his fitness. Days later, he suffered ruptured cruciate knee ligaments during a training session and the deal was axed.  When the transaction was completed in April 2001, United were forced to pay PSV an additional £500,000 for the player's services due to the change in exchange rates between Euro and Sterling. 
 Manchester United

 Van Nistelrooy signed a five-year contract after passing his medical.  During his first season , Van Nistelrooy scored 23 goals in 32 league games. He broke the record he shared with Mark Stein , Alan Shearer and Thierry Henry , by scoring in eight consecutive league games. He also scored 10 Champions League goals, and was named the PFA Players' Player of the Year . 
 The following season, he finished as the top Premier League scorer with 25 goals in 34 games, including three hat-tricks, and he ended the season on another eight-game scoring streak.  
 Van Nistelrooy missed most of the 2004–05 season due to injury, but nonetheless scored a Champions League -best eight goals. One of them was his thirtieth career European goal, which he scored in a 2–2 Champions League group stage draw with Lyon on 16 September 2004, overtaking Denis Law 's previous club record of 28 goals. Law later said to reporters, "I'm delighted for Ruud. It could not happen to a nicer guy."  Manchester United were eliminated by eventual finalists Milan in the knockout stage after going scoreless in both legs. 
 At the start of the 2005–06 season, Van Nistelrooy scored in United's first four Premier League games. He finished as the second-highest league scorer with 21 goals, behind Arsenal 's Thierry Henry. By the end of his fifth season with United, Van Nistelrooy had amassed 150 goals in fewer than 200 starts.

 Van Nistelrooy was benched for the League Cup Final against Wigan Athletic , fuelling speculation of a rift between him and Alex Ferguson, which Van Nistelrooy denied. He was nonetheless left on the bench for six consecutive league matches, and though he then returned to the starting line-up and scored match-winners against West Ham United and Bolton Wanderers , fresh doubt spread over Van Nistelrooy's future when he was benched for United's season finale win over Charlton Athletic . Ferguson claimed that Van Nistelrooy was angry at the decision and left the stadium three hours before kick-off. On 9 May 2006, Setanta Sports reported that Van Nistelrooy's exclusion from the squad was due to a training session fight between him and team-mate Cristiano Ronaldo . Van Nistelrooy allegedly criticised Ronaldo's tendency to hold onto the ball instead of passing to his team-mates, which sparked the fight, after which Van Nistelrooy remarked, "Go crying to your daddy."  
 Van Nistelrooy signed with Spanish La Liga side Real Madrid on 28 July, departing Old Trafford after five seasons with a total of 150 goals in 220 appearances. With 38 goals, he is also the club's all-time European top goalscorer.

 On 15 July 2006, Ferguson confirmed that Van Nistelrooy wanted to leave Manchester United and Real Madrid announced two weeks later that he had signed a three-year contract after being purchased for €14&#160;million.  
 Van Nistelrooy scored a hat-trick in his second league match against Levante and, on 12 November 2006, he scored all four of Real Madrid's goals in a 4–1 victory over Osasuna . He won the league's Pichichi award with 25 goals as Real Madrid took home the 2006–07 title , and he also equalled the longest consecutive scoring streak in La Liga history with seven straight matches, tying a league record shared by Hugo Sánchez .  
 In January 2008, Van Nistelrooy signed a contract extension keeping him with Madrid until 2010, with the expiration date one day shy of his 34th birthday.  He finished the season with 20 goals in 33 appearances.

 In November 2008, Real Madrid announced that Van Nistelrooy would miss the remainder of the 2008–09 season after exploratory arthroscopic surgery revealed a partially torn meniscus in his right knee, with an expected recovery time of six to nine months following a second operation to repair the damage.  On 27 October, Van Nistelrooy made his second comeback of the season coming on as a substitute for Raúl in the 71st minute against Alcorcon in the Copa del Rey . 
 Hamburger SV  
 On 23 January 2010, Van Nistelrooy signed an 18-month contract with the German club Hamburger SV until June 2011.  
 On 15 August 2010, Van Nistelrooy scored his only competitive hat-trick with Hamburg, in a 5–1 win over Torgelower SV Greif during round 1 of the 68th season of the DFB-Pokal .  During a match between Hamburg and Hannover 96 on 16 April 2011, Van Nistelrooy suffered a calf injury that kept him out until the last matchday. 
 Van Nistelrooy scored seven goals and made two assists in 25 appearances in his only full season with Hamburg.

 On 1 June 2011, Van Nistelrooy arrived at Málaga CF to sign a one-year contract with the La Liga club on a free transfer.  Van Nistelrooy made his debut in a 2–1 loss against Sevilla on the opening game of the season. 
 On 1 October 2011, while playing against Getafe , he scored his first goal for Málaga. On 21 December, against the same club, he opened the scoring with a volley as Málaga won 3–2 on aggregate in the Copa del Rey . Later on towards the season, Van Nistelrooy scored two more goals in the league against Espanyol and Racing de Santander , which was the last goal of his career. Just one day before his retirement, Van Nistelrooy made his last appearance of his career, coming on as a substitute in a 75th minutes for goalscorer José Salomón Rondón who scored the only goal in the game against Sporting de Gijón . 
 On 14 May 2012, he announced his retirement from football at the age of 35.  
 International career  
 Van Nistelrooy earned 70 caps and scored 35 goals for the Netherlands . He made his debut for the national team in a friendly match against Germany on 18 November 1998.

 As the Dutch failed to qualify for the 2002 World Cup , Van Nistelrooy did not make his tournament debut for the Netherlands until Euro 2004 , where he and the Czech Republic 's Milan Baroš were the only players to score in all three group stage matches. During a 2006 World Cup qualifying match , he scored in the Dutch's 4–0 hammering of bottom-placed Andorra and was yellow-carded for going to Andorra player Antoni Lima and celebrating in front of him, following an incident six minutes before when Van Nistelrooy missed a penalty and Lima laughed at him.  He started, and was substituted, in all of the Netherlands' group stage matches, and scored his lone goal against the Côte d'Ivoire . Van Nistelrooy was dropped to the bench by Van Basten without an explanation for the Netherlands' second round match, which saw them eliminated by Portugal . 
 Van Basten left the striker out of the squad for a friendly against Ireland on 16 August 2006.  After Klaas-Jan Huntelaar was unavailable for Euro 2008 qualifiers against Bulgaria and Belarus due to injury, Van Nistelrooy refused Van Basten's request to take his place on the roster. 
 On 23 January 2007, Van Nistelrooy announced his retirement from international football following continued disputes with coach Marco van Basten, which had started back in 2006 during the course of the World Cup finals matches.  and scored the winning goal four days later in injury time of the Netherlands' win over Albania . 
 At Euro 2008 , Van Nistelrooy scored for the Netherlands in their decisive 3–0 victory over Italy in the group stage, and scored the equaliser in their eventual 3–1 loss to Russia in the quarter-finals. On 4 August, he again announced his retirement from international competition.  
 During the build up to the 2010 World Cup Van Nistelrooy again made himself available, but was left out by the Netherlands' new coach Bert van Marwijk .  
 After main striker Robin van Persie suffered an injury during a match with his club Arsenal , Van Marwijk gave Van Nistelrooy a chance to reclaim his position as the main striker of the Netherlands' national team. Van Nistelrooy was invited to two Netherlands' Group E qualification matches for Euro 2012 against San Marino and Finland .  
 He was again recalled to the squad in March 2011 for two Euro 2012 qualification games with Hungary , after injuries to strikers Klaas-Jan Huntelaar, Arjen Robben and Theo Janssen .  
 Personal life  
 Family  
 Van Nistelrooy married his girlfriend, Leontien Slaats, in July 2004.  
 Charity work  
 Van Nistelrooy and his wife are both heavily involved with the charity organization SOS Children's Villages . The organization has been around since 1949 and is an international development charity which serves to protect the interests and rights of children. Van Nistelrooy was officially appointed "FIFA for SOS Children's Villages" Ambassador in the Netherlands on 1 September 2001.  
 On 17 November 2009, Van Nistelrooy and his wife hosted SOS at Real Madrid City . The purpose of the event was to help create a calendar which would be sold to benefit the organization.
