 Landon Timothy Donovan (born March 4, 1982) is an American soccer player currently playing for the Los Angeles Galaxy and the United States men's national team . He has played for Bayer Leverkusen , San Jose Earthquakes , Bayern Munich , and Everton . He usually plays as a withdrawn forward for the Galaxy, but he is just as effective as an attacking midfielder on either wing playing for the U.S. 
 A member of the inaugural class of the U.S. Soccer residency program in Bradenton, Florida , Donovan was declared player of the tournament for his role in the United States U17 that finished fourth in the 1999 FIFA U-17 World Championship , Donovan later signed with the German team Bayer Leverkusen . After six years with the club, the majority of which was spent on loan at the San Jose Earthquakes , Donovan moved to the Los Angeles Galaxy in 2005, though he returned to the Bundesliga for a three-month spell at the start of 2009 on loan to Bayern Munich . He went on loan again from January to March 2010 with English Premier League team Everton . 
 For the United States men's national team , Donovan is the all-time leader in scoring and assists, and has the most caps of all active players.  Donovan starred in the U.S. team that reached the quarter-finals of the 2002 FIFA World Cup where he received the Best Young Player Award . His three goals in the 2010 FIFA World Cup made Donovan the highest scoring American player in World Cup history and the third American player to score in more than one World Cup (after Brian McBride and Clint Dempsey ). 
 Donovan is widely considered to be the best player to ever come out of the United States.

 Early years  
 Donovan was born on March 4, 1982, in Ontario, California , to Donna Kenney-Cash, a special education teacher, and Tim Donovan, a semi-professional ice hockey player originally from Canada.  
 When Donovan was six, his mother allowed him to join an organized league, and he scored seven goals in his first game.  
 Club career  
 Bayer Leverkusen/San Jose Earthquakes

 Later in 1999 Donovan signed a six-year contract for German club Bayer Leverkusen , whose sporting director Michael Reschke spotted him at a youth tournament in Europe.  
 In 2004 Donovan became the first man to be named U.S. Soccer Athlete of the Year three years in a row,  
 Los Angeles Galaxy  
 In his first season with the Galaxy, Donovan scored twelve league goals and ten assists and added four goals and an assist in the playoffs as the Galaxy won the MLS Cup (his third MLS championship to date). He was named to the MLS All-Time Best XI after the season.

 Donovan had a mixed year with the Galaxy in 2007. Upon the signing and arrival of David Beckham , Donovan relinquished his captaincy to the English superstar. In the 2007 SuperLiga tournament, Donovan was the top scorer. Donovan scored a goal in every game except for the final. At this point in his career, Donovan had eighty-four all-time regular season goals putting him in seventh place on the league's all time scoring list . Although the 2008 season was a disappointment for the Galaxy, it was a banner year for Donovan as he scored twenty goals and nine assists in twenty-five games, forming a strong offensive partnership with David Beckham and Edson Buddle .  
 After his former national team manager Bruce Arena was named Galaxy head coach and Beckham joined AC Milan on loan in early 2009, Donovan once again was given the club captaincy on a permanent basis. In July 2009, Donovan received praise and criticism for his critical comments about Beckham in Sports Illustrated journalist Grant Wahl 's book The David Beckham Experiment , calling Beckham a poor captain and teammate. He later apologized to Beckham for discussing his concerns to a reporter rather than to him directly.  
 The Galaxy had another successful campaign in 2010 winning the Supporters' Shield for the first time since 2003. In that campaign, Donovan notched 7 goals and a team high 16 assists. In the playoffs , the Galaxy would ultimately succumb to FC Dallas in the semifinals. 
 In 2011, the Galaxy again won the MLS Supporter's Shield. In the 2011 MLS Cup , Donovan scored the title-clinching goal in the 72nd minute over the Houston Dynamo, securing his 4th MLS Cup title.  Donovan was named the MLS Cup MVP. 
 In October 2012, Donovan expressed his desire to take a break from his professional soccer career, citing physical and mental exhaustion as the main reasons.  In the Galaxy's next game, the 2012 MLS Cup, a rematch with Houston, Donovan converted a penalty kick in the 65th minute of play to give LA a 2–1 lead. The goal was Donovan's fifth in MLS Cup Finals. The Galaxy went on to win their second straight MLS Cup, 3–1. 
 Donovan returned to training with the Galaxy on March 25, 2013 and made his season debut five days later against Toronto FC, coming on as a 61st minute substitute. However, upon his return it was announced that he would be forced to relinquish the captaincy to Robbie Keane for the 2013 season. He scored two goals against C.D. Chivas USA tying him with Jeff Cunningham together as the top MLS goalscorer with 134 goals.

 In November 2008 Donovan trained with Bayern Munich ,  
 After the 2009 MLS season had finished, Donovan joined English Premier League side Everton on loan in January 2010, though there was strong suggestions he could join his American teammates at Fulham F.C.  Everton also wanted to sign Donovan in the summer transfer window but due to lack of funds, no formal offer was made. 
 An agreement was reached in December 2011 for Donovan to spend another two months at Everton beginning in January 2012.  Donovan made his returning debut for Everton on January 4, 2012 against Bolton Wanderers , Everton lost 2–1. In his third game on loan, he assisted Everton's only goal in a 1–1 draw against Aston Villa on January 14, 2012. On January 27, 2012, Donovan assisted in both goals in a 2–1 win over Fulham in the FA Cup Fourth round Proper. On January 31, 2012, he assisted in Darron Gibson 's winning goal over Manchester City . Donovan took his tally of assists to 7 when he assisted Denis Stracqualursi 's goal in a 2–0 victory over Chelsea on February 11, 2012. 
 International career

 Donovan was a member of the inaugural class at U.S. Soccer 's full-time residency program at the IMG Academy , in Bradenton, Florida . He won the Golden Ball at the 1999 FIFA U-17 World Championship as the tournament's best player. In his two years playing for the U-17 team, he scored 35 goals in 41 games.  Lee later died in 2003. 
 Donovan made his World Cup Finals debut in the 2002 World Cup starting in the shock upset of pre-tournament favorites Portugal, a match the Americans won 3–2. Donovan's cross in the 29th minute deflected in off Jorge Costa , giving the U.S. a 2–0 lead. Later, Donovan would tally his first World Cup Finals goal in the 83rd minute of a 3–1 loss to Poland in the third match of the group stage. He then scored his second goal of the tournament on a header which clinched a 2–0 "Round of 16" victory for the Americans over arch-rival Mexico. Though the U.S. would go on to lose 1–0 to Germany in the quarterfinals, Donovan would later be named "Best Young Player" of the tournament.  
 In 2006, he became the United States' all-time assist leader with twenty-three when he set up Ben Olsen ; the previous all-time assist leader was Cobi Jones .  
 Donovan was a member of the U.S. squad at the 2006 World Cup , in which the Americans were eliminated in the group stage. He led the U.S. to the 2007 Gold Cup title with 4 goals, including a crucial penalty in the 2–1 victory over Mexico in the final. On January 19, 2008, Donovan scored his 35th international goal, a penalty against Sweden , and passed Eric Wynalda as the United States' all-time leading goal scorer. Donovan reached 100 caps at the age of 26 on June 8, 2008, in a friendly against Argentina that ended in a 0–0 draw, and was the fourth-youngest person to do so.  
 Donovan captained the U.S. in the group stage of the 2009 FIFA Confederations Cup due to Carlos Bocanegra 's injury absence. Donovan scored on a penalty kick against Italy , shortly after his team had been reduced to 10 men, and scored for the United States in a 3–2 defeat to Brazil in the final. On October 10, 2009, Donovan scored on a free kick, giving the U.S. a 3–2 victory over Honduras in San Pedro Sula , clinching a berth in the 2010 World Cup . 
 Donovan was included in the squad for the 2010 World Cup, and played all four games in the United States' campaign. He scored against Slovenia with a shot straight up into goal past the goalkeeper's face, in a 2–2 tie,  His total of five World Cup goals is the most for any man representing a team from CONCACAF. 
 After missing the first three World Cup Qualifiers of 2013 due to his self-imposed sabbatical , Donovan was left off of the squad by Jürgen Klinsmann for the June qualifying games despite having returned to playing full-time in March.  
 Donovan was recalled to the full national squad for the first time in over a year for the USA's September World Cup qualifying matches against Costa Rica and Mexico. Donovan started and played 90 minutes in both games. With the US needing a win over Mexico to clinch qualification, Donovan's corner kick assisted Eddie Johnson's game-winning goal in the 57th minute. Then, in the 78th minute, Donovan scored a tap in goal off a low cross from Mix Diskerud to make the score 2-0, and effectively seal the win, and the World Cup berth.
