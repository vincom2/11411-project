 Hope Amelia Solo (born July 30, 1981) is an American soccer goalkeeper and a two-time Olympic gold medalist from Richland, Washington . She has been goalkeeping for the United States women's national soccer team since 2000. After playing at the collegiate level for the University of Washington , she played professionally for the Philadelphia Charge in the Women's United Soccer Association (WUSA). When the WUSA folded after her first season, she traveled to Europe to play for the top division leagues in Sweden and France. From 2009 to 2011, she played in the Women's Professional Soccer (WPS) for Saint Louis Athletica , Atlanta Beat and magicJack . After the WPS ceased operations in early 2012, she played for the Seattle Sounders in the W-League . She currently plays for Seattle Reign FC in the National Women's Soccer League , the top division of women's soccer in the United States. 
 Solo is regarded as one of the top goalkeepers in the world.  She was the starting goalkeeper for the majority of the 2007 FIFA Women's World Cup and helped lead the U.S. national team to the semifinals having given up only two goals in four games, including three consecutive shutouts . After a controversial move made by head coach Greg Ryan to bench Solo in favor of veteran goalkeeper Brianna Scurry for the semifinal, in which the United States was defeated 4–0 by Brazil , Solo made headlines with post-game remarks that resulted in many teammates shunning her. With dedication, tough-mindedness and skill, she rebounded to help the United States win gold medals at the 2008 and 2012 Summer Olympics . During the 2011 FIFA Women's World Cup , her exceptional skill was highlighted especially during a quarter-final match against Brazil, in which the U.S. defeated Brazil in penalty kicks . Although the team lost to Japan in an intensely close match that ended in penalties, Solo received the Golden Glove award for best goalkeeper as well as the Bronze Ball award for her overall performance at the tournament. 
 Following her performance at the 2011 World Cup, Solo participated in the television show, Dancing with the Stars and posed for various magazines, most notably the "Body Issue " of ESPN The Magazine . After the 2012 London Olympics, where she received her second Olympic gold medal, she published her best-selling autobiography Solo: A Memoir of Hope .

 Early life 
 Solo was born in Richland , Washington on July 30, 1981, the daughter of Judy Lynn (née Shaw) and Jeffrey Solo.  
 As a forward at Richland High School , Solo scored 109 goals, leading her team to three consecutive league titles from 1996–1998 and a state championship during her senior year.  
 Washington Huskies 
 After being heavily recruited by several colleges around the country, Solo attended the University of Washington from 1999 to 2002 where she majored in speech communications.  
 Solo became the top goalkeeper in Pac-10 history and finished her collegiate career as Washington’s all-time leader in shutouts (18), saves (325) and goals against average (GAA) (1.02).  
 Club career 
 WUSA and European professional leagues, 2003–05 
 Following her college career, Solo was selected in the first round (fourth overall) of the 2003 WUSA Draft by the Philadelphia Charge .  
 The WPS years, 2009–11 
 Saint Louis Athletica 
 
 
 
  
Solo saves a shot from the Boston Breakers in April 2010. 
 
 
 On September 16, 2008, Solo was one of three national team players allocated to the Saint Louis Athletica in the WPS as part of the 2008 WPS Player Allocation , with the new league slated to begin play in April 2009. Solo let in six goals in the first four games as Athletica got off to a very slow 0–2–2 start in their first season. She conceded eight goals in her next 13 games and finished the season with eight shutouts, helping lead the Athletica from the bottom of the standings to finish second place and secure a playoff spot.  
 After the 2009 season , Solo was named the WPS Goalkeeper of the Year. She also became the first goalkeeper to be named U.S. Soccer Female Athlete of the Year , the highest honor awarded to a soccer player in the United States.  
 Atlanta Beat 
 In May 2010, the Saint Louis Athletica folded and Solo signed with WPS expansion team, Atlanta Beat , along with her St. Louis teammates, Tina Ellertson and Eniola Aluko .  
 Solo played in 22 WPS matches in 2010 for both the Athletica and the Beat and was the league-leader in saves with 104. The two-time WPS All-Star also ranked among the top three in shutouts (6), wins (6), and goals against average (1.64). After the end of the 2010 season , Solo underwent surgery on her right shoulder on September 22. "These next two years are huge for the national team with the World Cup and Olympics on the horizon and I wanted to make sure that I would be giving my team and my country my best on the field," Solo said of the surgery. "I've been having some painful issues with the shoulder for a while and for a goalkeeper it's been difficult physically and mentally to play with this kind of an injury, so it was time to get it taken care of."  
 magicJack 
 Ahead of the 2011 Women's Professional Soccer season , Solo signed for magicJack , formerly the Washington Freedom under new ownership. Between her shoulder surgery recovery, national team commitments and preparation for the 2011 FIFA Women's World Cup , Solo missed a significant part of the season. She made four appearances for the club, tallying a total of 360 minutes.  
 Seattle Sounders Women, 2012 
 On February 14, 2012, it was announced that Solo had signed with the Seattle Sounders Women .  
 NWSL: a new era, 2013–present 
 
 
 
  
Solo makes a save during a match against the Chicago Red Stars on July 25, 2013 at Starfire Stadium in Tukwila, Washington. 
 
 
 Seattle Reign FC 
 On January 19, 2013 it was announced that Solo was one of three members from the United States women's national team, along with Megan Rapinoe and Amy Rodriguez , allocated to the Seattle Reign FC for the inaugural season of the National Women's Soccer League , as part of the NWSL Player Allocation .  
 In October 2013 Solo was linked with a transfer to English club Manchester City . Despite the relatively high salary reportedly on offer in Manchester, Seattle Reign coach Laura Harvey expected Solo to return to the NWSL for 2014, to safeguard her place in the national team.  
 International career 
 Solo played for U.S. junior national soccer teams before joining the full U.S. national team in 2000. Her senior debut came in an 8–0 win over Iceland at Davidson, North Carolina in April 2000.  She was named a member of the Olympic team in 2004, making the 2004 Olympics in Athens as an alternate . Solo has been the team's first choice goalkeeper since 2005. She has recorded several clean sheets and once went 1,054 minutes without allowing a goal, a streak that ended in a 4–1 victory against France in the Algarve Cup . 
 2007 FIFA Women's World Cup 
 Solo was the starting goalkeeper for the United States in the 2007 FIFA Women's World Cup , giving up two goals in four games including consecutive shutouts of Sweden , Nigeria and England . Heading into the semifinal match against Brazil , U.S. coach Greg Ryan benched Solo in favor of 36-year-old veteran U.S. keeper Briana Scurry , who had a strong history of performance against the Brazilians but had not played a complete game in three months.  
 Post-2007 World Cup fallout 
 In an impromptu interview following the match, a clearly upset Solo criticized Ryan's decision.  
 Solo was named to the U.S. women's national soccer team roster for the post-World Cup tour, but did not attend the first workout ahead of the first game against Mexico . Even though the players' contract with the federation stipulated that anyone on the World Cup roster had the right to play in the tour, she did not play in any of the three games against Mexico, being replaced by Briana Scurry for the first and third matches, and Nicole Barnhart for the second. The third match against Mexico, on October 20, 2007, marked the end of the U.S. women's national team's 2007 season. The team regrouped in January 2008 to begin preparations for the 2008 Summer Olympics .  
 2008 Summer Olympics 
 
 
 
  
Solo with her 2008 Olympic gold medal 
 
 
 On June 23, 2008, it was announced Solo would be the starting goalkeeper for the U.S. team at the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing. In a reversal of roles from the 2004 Olympics, Briana Scurry did not make the team, though she was an alternate. On August 21, the U.S. women's team won the gold medal by defeating Brazil 1–0 in extra time, in no small measure due to Solo's performance as she stopped an energetic Brazilian attack, making save after save.  
 2011 FIFA Women's World Cup 
 Despite missing much of the qualifying campaign with a shoulder injury, Solo was named to the U.S. roster for the 2011 FIFA Women's World Cup in Germany.  After keeping clean sheets in group C wins over North Korea and Colombia , Solo conceded two goals in the 2–1 loss to Sweden which consigned the Americans to second place in the group and a quarterfinal meeting with Brazil. 
 The quarterfinal match between the U.S. and Brazil was sent into a penalty shoot-out after U.S. forward Abby Wambach tied the game at 2–2 in stoppage time at the end of extra-time. Solo saved the third Brazil penalty kick by Daiane , helping the U.S. secure a semifinal spot against France .  
 Solo became the twenty-seventh American woman and second goalkeeper to reach 100 caps with her start in the 3–1 semifinal win over France.  
 In the final , the U.S. team lost 3–1 in a penalty shootout to Japan , after twice taking the lead in an eventual 2–2 draw. Solo expressed admiration for the Japanese team and offered her congratulations.  
 2012 Summer Olympics 
 Leading up to the Summer Olympics , Solo received a public warning from the U.S. Anti-Doping Agency (USADA) after a June 15 urine test concluded the banned substance Canrenone had been detected. Solo said in a statement she had been prescribed a pre-menstrual medication and was not aware it contained any banned substances. She cooperated with the USADA and provided them with the necessary information to prove that it was a mistake. Her story checked out and she was cleared with a public warning.  The positive test did not require Solo to withdraw from any pre-Olympic matches.

 In a 4–2 defeat of France in the opening match, France took an early 2–0 lead in 15 minutes. After Abby Wambach reduced the lead to 2–1 with a 19th minute header off a Megan Rapinoe corner kick , Solo assisted Alex Morgan at the 32nd minute to score and level the match at 2–2; she took a free-kick sending the ball to Morgan who kicked the ball after a bounce, over goalkeeper Sarah Bouhaddi into the goal.  
 On August 9, Solo won her second Olympic gold medal with the United States women's national soccer team . In a 2–1 defeat of Japan in the final match, Solo made many saves, including an 82nd minute save of a powerful shot from Mana Iwabuchi , which could have tied the match.  
 Solo kept three clean sheets, two in group-stage against Colombia with 3–0 and Korea DPR with 1–0, and a 2–0 win against New Zealand in the quarter-final.
