 Alexandra Patricia "Alex" Morgan (born July 2, 1989) is an American soccer player and Olympic gold medalist . She is a forward for National Women's Soccer League club Portland Thorns FC and the U.S. Women's National Team . Morgan was drafted number one overall in the 2011 WPS Draft by the Western New York Flash where she made her professional debut. She was the youngest player on the U.S. roster at the 2011 FIFA Women's World Cup . Her record-breaking game-winning goal in the 123rd minute against Canada during the 2012 London Olympics was her 20th goal in 2012 and propelled her to becoming the sixth and youngest U.S. player to do so in a single year. Morgan finished 2012 with 28 goals and 21 assists, joining Mia Hamm as the only American women to score 20 goals and 20 assists in the same calendar year. She was subsequently named U.S. Soccer Female Athlete of the Year and was a FIFA World Player of the Year finalist. 
 Off the field, Morgan has a deal with Simon &amp; Schuster to write a middle-grade book series about four soccer players entitled The Kicks . The first book in the series, Saving the Team ( ISBN 1442485701 ), debuted at number seven on the The New York Times Best Seller list for Children's Middle Grade in May 2013. Her second book, Sabotage Season , was released in September 2013.

 Due to an anterior cruciate ligament injury that slowed her progress in 2007, Morgan was not called up to train with the United States under-20 women's national soccer team until April 2008.  
 Morgan was named to the United States U-20 women's national team that competed in the 2008 FIFA U-20 Women's World Cup in Chile, scoring a total of four goals in the tournament against France , Argentina and North Korea . Morgan's fourth goal of the tournament was a match-winner that gave the U.S. a gold medal, which subsequently voted the best goal of the tournament,  
 She has been capped by the senior national team, first appearing as a substitute in a match versus Mexico in March 2010,

She scored the first goal (69') in the FIFA World Cup Final against Japan after coming on as a substitute at the half, as well as assisting on the Abby Wambach header (104') for a goal in extra time. Her performance made her the first player to ever record a goal and an assist in a World Cup final.
