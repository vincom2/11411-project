 Club career  
 Early career  
 Iniesta comes from a small village named Fuentealbilla in the province of Albacete , Castile–La Mancha . At the age of 12, while playing for Albacete Balompié in a junior seven-a-side tournament in Albacete , he attracted the attention of scouts from many clubs around Spain.  He captained the Barcelona Under-15 team to victory in the Nike Premier Cup of 1999, scoring the winning goal in the last minute of the final, and being named player of the tournament. 
 2004–2008  
 In the 2004–05 season Iniesta featured in 37 out of 38 league games—more than any other player—although 25 of these were substitute appearances. He scored twice as Barcelona won La Liga.  
 
 
 
  
Andrés Iniesta with Barcelona in 2006 
 
 
 The 2006–07 season saw Iniesta's profile continue to rise and he earned plaudits for his willingness to play in any position for his team. On 22 August 2006, after defeating German side Bayern Munich 4–0, Iniesta lifted the Joan Gamper Trophy as the captain of the team. He played for the first time as a left wing-forward for Barcelona in two Champions League matches against Levski Sofia , finding the net twice. In the first knockout stage of the same competition, he played at central midfield against Liverpool . Despite being moved around the pitch by manager Rijkaard, the 2006–07 season remains Iniesta's highest scoring thus far. 
 With the departure of Ludovic Giuly over the summer break, Iniesta was able to switch his number 24 shirt for his preferred number 8.  
 According to the Spanish football magazine Don Balón , a member of European Sports Magazines , Iniesta has been one of the most consistent performers in the last two seasons of the Primera Division, placing fifth in 2006–07  Barcelona team-mates Lionel Messi , Samuel Eto'o , and Xavi also featured in the top ten. 
 2008–09  
 
 
 
  
Andrés Iniesta warming up for Barcelona 
 
 
 In September 2008, after the departure of former vice-captain Ronaldinho to Milan , the Barcelona squad decided on its new team captains. Iniesta was named fourth-choice behind, in order of preference, Carles Puyol , Xavi and Víctor Valdés ; all four were products of the Barcelona youth system.  
 On 5 February, Iniesta made his 250 th appearance for Barcelona in the Copa del Rey match against Mallorca. Iniesta once again got injured in Barcelona's home match against Málaga CF , but returned to action for the first leg Champions League quarter-final clash against Bayern Munich, which Barcelona won 4–0. 
 Former teammate Samuel Eto'o described Iniesta as being "the best player in the world; whenever Iniesta is on the pitch, he creates a spectacle."  
 Iniesta scored a vital equaliser from outside the penalty area in the final minute of stoppage time during the second leg of the Champions League semi-final against Chelsea , securing the tie on away goals as the match finished 1–1.  
 
 
 
 "I knew I would play injured and do more damage. For 17 days, all I thought about was the final in Rome and winning, even knowing that I would do more damage. I'd repeat it, for sure. I love this club and my profession and I wanted to win. If we had lost the final that would have been a total disaster." 
 
 
 Andrés Iniesta, September 2009  
 
 This goal sent Barcelona through to the 2009 UEFA Champions League Final in Rome against defending champions Manchester United . Prior to the final, Manchester United manager Alex Ferguson said: "I'm not obsessed with Messi, Iniesta is the danger. He's fantastic. He makes the team work. The way he finds passes, his movement and ability to create space is incredible. He's so important for Barcelona."  
 Don Balón rated him as the most consistent performer in the 2008–09 La Liga season, ahead of team-mates Xavi and Lionel Messi .  
 2009–10  
 On 18 October, Iniesta was included in a list of 30 candidates for the prestigious Ballon d'Or , given to the top player of the year in Europe, along with teammates Xavi and Lionel Messi and former teammates Thierry Henry , Yaya Touré , Zlatan Ibrahimović , and current Chelsea striker Samuel Eto'o . Andrés was one of five nominations for the World Player of the Year award alongside teammates Lionel Messi, and Xavi Hernandez. Proud of the nomination, he commented that "the fans of the team who have always been there to support our team-mates also deserve to be recognised". The ceremony was held in Zürich and teammate Lionel Messi took home the award. Iniesta placed fifth with 134 votes.  
 On 27 November 2009, he made a one-year extension to his Barcelona contract which now runs until 2015; his buy-out clause was raised again from €150&#160;million to €200&#160;million.  
 2010–11

 After being given extended rest by Spain coach Vicente del Bosque following the World Cup , Iniesta returned to Barcelona for a pre-season medical on 9 August 2010.  
 Iniesta scored his first goal of the season for Barcelona during the opening La Liga fixture against Racing Santander, lobbing the ball into the net from a distance of 30 yards.  Barcelona won the match 5–1. 
 He was one of the three finalists for the 2010 FIFA Ballon d'Or along with Barcelona teammates Xavi and Messi , and came second as Messi won the award.  
 2011–12  
 Iniesta started the 2011–12 season by scoring the opening goal in the second leg of the Supercopa de España against rivals Real Madrid . Barcelona went on to win the match 3–2 and the cup 5–4 on aggregate. 
 
 
 
  
Iniesta during the 2012–13 season 
 
 
 On 19 October, Iniesta scored one of the best goals in the UEFA Champions League group stage after a good interchange of passes with Lionel Messi. On 17 March 2012, playing against Sevilla FC at Estadio Ramón Sánchez Pizjuán , Iniesta equaled Emilio Butragueno's record of 50 matches unbeaten in the Spanish La Liga .  On 24 March 2012, Barcelona defeated RCD Mallorca 2–0, marking Iniesta's 51st match unbeaten in the league. 
 After a long goal drought of goals in the Champions League, he scored a vital goal against AC Milan in the quarterfinal. From there he went on to score in the semifinal against Chelsea FC to make it 2–0, but Chelsea FC came back and the game ended 2–2. Iniesta was named the "Best Player" of the 2011–12 UEFA Champions League .  
 2012–13  
 On 25 November 2012 Iniesta was named man of the match after scoring one goal and creating three others in a 4–0 win over Levante UD in the league.  At the 2012 FIFA Ballon d'Or , he was one of the 11 players in the best squad of the year. 
 2013–14  
 On 19 December 2013, Barcelona's President Sandro Rosell announced that Iniesta had signed a new contract with the Culés , keeping him at the club until 2018.  
 International career

 Iniesta burst on to the international scene in 2001, helping Spain win the UEFA European Under-16 Championship, and was in the squad that claimed the UEFA European Under-19 Championship the following year. Since then, he became a regular choice for youth coach Juan Santisteban . In 2003, he formed part of the Spanish side that reached the FIFA World Youth Championship final in the United Arab Emirates , and was named in the FIFA all-star team. During his spell with the Spain U21 side, Iniesta was named captain on several occasions. 
 Originally a fringe player, he was called up to represent Spain at the World Cup 2006 on 15 May 2006, much to the surprise of many. Iniesta won his first cap for Spain when he was brought on at half-time in a friendly against Russia on 27 May 2006. 
 He scored his first goal for Spain in a friendly against England on 7 February 2007. His long range effort, hitting the underside of the crossbar on the way in, gave Spain the lead on 63 minutes. Iniesta proceeded to play a pivotal part in Spain's qualification for Euro 2008 by scoring goals against Sweden and by assisting the strikers. Iniesta usually played in the middle of the pitch, but he was also trusted with roles further up the pitch when Spain was away from home -- most notably in the game against Denmark, where he was given an advanced left wing position. 
 Iniesta was selected in Spain's squad for UEFA Euro 2008 in Austria and Switzerland. Though a stomach ailment somewhat hampered his performances in the group stages, he still played an integral part in the midfield. He played in the first two of Spain's group stage matches and proved an important part of the team, providing a particularly notable pass for David Villa 's second goal against Russia. He was not rested, unlike most of Spain's regulars, for the final group game against Greece (which Spain won 2–1 thanks to a fantastic volley from Rubén de la Red and a late winner from Daniel Güiza ), and returned for the quarter-final as Spain beat Italy on penalties. Iniesta was substituted before the penalty shootout itself. In the semi-final against Russia he played the entire 90 minutes and produced a quality cross which Xavi converted to open the scoring. The Technical Study Group named him the Man of the Match.  He played the full duration of the final in Spain's 1–0 win over Germany . Iniesta was named in the Team of the Tournament alongside fellow Spain midfielders Xavi, Marcos Senna , and 6 other teammates. 
 Iniesta did not participate in the 2009 Confederations Cup in South Africa due to a thigh muscle injury. Spain was eliminated from the tournament.

 He was called for the 2010 World Cup , and scored the second goal in a 2–1 win against Chile . He was also named man of the match .  
 Europa Press reported that Iniesta was the most popular Spanish sportsman on the Internet throughout 2010. The study performed by company Vipnet360 examined the web presence on platforms like Facebook, Twitter and YouTube. Iniesta was followed by Iker Casillas , David Villa , Rafael Nadal , and Fernando Alonso rounding the top 5.  
 In the UEFA Euro 2012 , Iniesta was awarded the man of the match award for his performances in three different matches. He was also selected as man of the match in the final against Italy , which Spain won 4–0. By winning the award, Iniesta became the only Spanish player to win the award at least once in each of Spain's three consecutive successful tournaments.  
 Style of play

 Like fellow La Masia graduate Cesc Fàbregas , Iniesta originally started as a defensive midfielder  
 His willingness to play anywhere on the pitch has earned him the sobriquet El Ilusionista (The Illusionist), El Cerebro (The Brain), El Anti-Galáctico (a pun on Real Madrid players' nickname Los Galácticos ), El Caballero Pálido (The Pale Knight)  as one of the greatest midfielders ever to play the game. 
 Personal life  
 Since 2008, Iniesta has dated Anna Ortiz,  
 Iniesta has a majority share at his boyhood club Albacete after injecting €420,000 into the cash-trapped club in 2011, with his father José Antonio appointed on the board of directors. In June 2013, Iniesta - who was a former youth player at Albacete until 1996 - stepped in with another €240,000 investment to save the club from administrative relegation after being unable to pay player wages.
