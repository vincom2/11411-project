 Clinton Drew "Clint" Dempsey  /  ˈ  d  ɛ  m  p  s  i  / (born 9 March 1983) is an American soccer player who plays for Seattle Sounders FC in Major League Soccer . He is the captain of the United States national team .  He has also played for New England Revolution and Tottenham Hotspur . 
 Growing up in Nacogdoches, Texas , Dempsey played for one of the top youth soccer clubs in the state, the Dallas Texans , before playing for Furman University 's men's soccer team. In 2004, Dempsey was drafted by Major League Soccer club New England Revolution , where he quickly integrated himself into the starting lineup. Hindered initially by a jaw injury, he would eventually score 25 goals in 71 appearances with the Revolution. Between 2007 and 2012, Dempsey played for Premier League team Fulham and is the club's highest Premier League goalscorer of all time.  
 Dempsey first represented the United States at the 2003 FIFA World Youth Championship in the United Arab Emirates . He made his first appearance with the senior team on November 17, 2004, against Jamaica ; he was then named in the squad for the 2006 FIFA World Cup and scored the team's only goal of the tournament. Dempsey recorded the fastest goal in US World Cup qualifying history by scoring after 53 seconds of an eventual 8–0 defeat of Barbados . He later bested that feat in 2012 scoring just 36 seconds into a 2–1 qualifying loss at Jamaica. In the 2010 FIFA World Cup , Dempsey scored against England , becoming the second American, after Brian McBride , to score goals in multiple World Cup tournaments.

 Early life and career  
 Dempsey was born in Nacogdoches , Texas and, for much of his childhood, his family lived in a trailer park , where he and his siblings grew up playing soccer with the local children or anyone they could find. His older brother Ryan was offered a tryout for the Dallas Texans , an elite youth soccer club, and brought Clint, who was noticed and recruited while passing time juggling a ball on the sidelines.  Several parents of his teammates with the Texans offered to assist the Dempseys with expenses and travel, allowing him to rejoin the club. 
 On November 27, 1995, Dempsey lost his then 16-year-old sister Jennifer to a brain aneurysm. Dempsey was devastated with the family's loss and later explained that this event helped him develop a deeper motivation to pursue soccer; in honor of his sister. 
 He went on to be the captain and high scorer of the Texans and was honored with the MVP of the Tampa Bay Sun Bowl tournament. Dempsey studied the play of Argentina's national team , especially Diego Maradona , and was heartbroken when the news came to Nacogdoches that Maradona would not be playing in the 1994 World Cup game played in the Cotton Bowl .  He attended Furman University as a health and exercise major and a key player for Paladins soccer. 
 Club career  
 New England Revolution  
 New England Revolution selected Clint Dempsey eighth overall in the 2004 MLS SuperDraft . In his rookie season, he started 23 of 24 matches scoring seven goals. Dempsey helped the Revolution to the Eastern Conference Finals and earned 2004 MLS Rookie of the Year Honors. In 2005, Dempsey contributed ten goals and nine assists in 26 games. He scored the game-winning goal in the Eastern Conference Final on his way to an appearance in the MLS Cup Final . In 2006, Dempsey added 8 more goals, but missed significant time in the playoffs due to injury. He came on as a substitute in the MLS Cup Final , but the Revolution lost their second straight final, this time in a penalty shoot-out . 
 Fulham  
 In December 2006, English club Fulham offered MLS $ 4&#160;million for the transfer of Dempsey, then the largest amount ever offered for an MLS player and became another American addition to a Cottagers' squad which included US internationals Brian McBride and Carlos Bocanegra .  
 Dempsey was not in the starting XI for the first three matches of the 2007–08 season, but after an injury to Brian McBride, he came into the side as a striker and scored in a 2–1 defeat at Aston Villa .  
 Dempsey made the Fulham XI only once in the first eleven fixtures of the 2008–09 season but scored his first goal in a 1–1 away draw at Portsmouth on October 26 after coming on as a substitute.  
 
 
 
  
Dempsey training with Fulham in August 2009 
 
 
 On August 13, 2009, Dempsey signed a contract extension to remain with Fulham through 2013.  
 Dempsey was on the substitutes' bench for Fulham's first two away games of 2010–11, but became a regular starter, one of only five USA players in the Premier League to do so. On September 18, 2010, he scored an equalising goal on 56 minutes with a header against Blackburn Rovers at Ewood Park in the 1–1 draw to continue Fulham's unbeaten record in the Barclays Premier League.  
 On March 19, Dempsey became the first USA player to score 10 goals in a Premier League season, beating Brian McBride 's previous record of nine, also set while at Fulham in the 2005–06 season and 2006–07 season.  
 Clint Dempsey broke Fulham's Premier League goalscoring record by netting twice in a 3–0 victory over Bolton on April 27, 2011. He has scored a total of 33 goals for the team in the Premier League, topping both Brian McBride and Steed Malbranque , each with 32. With these goals, he scored 12 goals for Fulham in the 2010–11 season.  
 Dempsey was voted Fulham player of the season for 2010–11 by the Fulham fans, and his 12 Premier League strikes meant he was the club's leading goalscorer for the campaign.  
 Dempsey scored a brace in the first leg of Fulham's 2011–12 Europa League play-off clash against Dnipro Dnipropetrovsk at Craven Cottage. Dempsey ended with two goals as Fulham ran out 3–0 winners, setting up a comfortable second leg in Ukraine.  
 In the club's West London derby against rivals Chelsea on Boxing Day , Dempsey scored the equalising goal as the game ended in a 1–1 draw.  This run of good form saw Dempsey play higher-up the field into an orthodox striker position. 
 He "assisted" another goal in a 2–1 win against Stoke City on February 11, 2012. His 28th-minute shot hit the crossbar and was deflected by Stoke goalkeeper Thomas Sørensen . It was therefore awarded as an own goal off the goalie. His form this season continued against Wolverhampton Wanderers where Dempsey scored twice in a 5–0 victory for Fulham.  
 Dempsey scored his fourteenth and fifteenth Premier League goals of the campaign, bringing his tally to twenty-one in all competitions, in a 3–0 away win over Bolton Wanderers on April 7, the first a free kick and the second a header.  
 On June 7, 2012, Dempsey was voted the Fulham 'Player of the Season' by fans for the second consecutive season.  
 Tottenham Hotspur  
 On August 31, 2012, Dempsey joined Tottenham Hotspur on a three-year contract for a fee believed to be in the region of £6&#160;million.  Dempsey was unable to make an impression against his old club on March 17, when Fulham came away from White Hart Lane with a 1–0 victory. On April 21, Dempsey scored the first of three goals for Tottenham in a 3–1 win over Manchester City at White Hart Lane. On May 12, Dempsey scored a long range goal and added an assist while playing against Stoke City to help Spurs win 2–1 and keep them in contention for the fourth Champions League spot. 
 On April 11, 2013, Dempsey scored two goals against FC Basel in the second leg of the Europa League quarter-finals to send the match into extra time. Tottenham eventually lost the match on penalties and thus were eliminated from Europe. 
 Seattle Sounders FC  
 On August 3, 2013, Dempsey signed with MLS club Seattle Sounders FC as a Designated Player on a four-year contract, for a transfer fee of $9&#160;million.  
 Loan to Fulham  
 On December 24, 2013 Dempsey re-signed with Fulham on a two-month loan.  
 International career  
 
 
 
  
Dempsey training with the United States in April 2006 
 
 
 Dempsey first played for the United States national team at the 2003 FIFA World Youth Championship in the United Arab Emirates. He made his first appearance with the senior team on November 17, 2004, against Jamaica . He has frequently lined up as a striker due to his scoring threat and aerial ability, but his preferred and more normal role is off the striker.  He won the highest individual honor in football in America when he was named Honda Player of the Year for 2006, beating Fulham teammates Kasey Keller and Brian McBride in a poll of sportswriters. Dempsey received 237 points in voting by 207 sports journalists to claim the award. 
 On May 2, 2006, Dempsey was named to the US roster for the 2006 World Cup in Germany. He was the only American player to score a goal in the tournament  with his equalizing goal in the Americans' eventual 2–1 loss to Ghana . 
 In the United States' opening 2010 World Cup qualifier, Dempsey recorded the then fastest goal in US qualifying history with a chest trap and sliding shot 53 seconds into a 8–0 defeat of Barbados . But thereafter, Dempsey experienced a dip in form leading some to doubt his first-choice status with the national team. However, Dempsey turned his fortunes around in the 2009 FIFA Confederations Cup . In the final group stage match against Egypt , Dempsey scored a trademark diving header off a Jonathan Spector cross, making the final result 3–0. This, combined with Brazil's 3–0 victory against Italy in the other group match that was being played simultaneously, put the United States through to the semi-finals.  He ended the World Cup qualifying campaign tied with Landon Donovan as the team's second top scorer, behind Jozy Altidore , with five goals in thirteen matches.

 On June 12, 2010, Dempsey became the second American (after Brian McBride) to score in more than one World Cup when he scored the equalizer goal against England in the Americans' first game of the 2010 World Cup after the England goalkeeper Robert Green made a major error. Dempsey's disallowed goal later in the tournament against Algeria in the group stage was very controversial. Dempsey was called offside, but the replay showed that he was most likely not offside. Despite this call, his teammate Landon Donovan scored a late stoppage time goal to win the game 1–0.  
 During the 2011 Gold Cup , Dempsey played a key role in helping the United States. advance to the final. In the group stages he recorded a goal in a 2–0 win over Canada , and in the quarter-finals, Dempsey also scored a goal in a 2–0 win over Jamaica. In the semi-finals against Panama , who had shockingly defeated the United States 1–2 in the group stage, Dempsey scored the only goal to advance the Americans to the final . With a sliding touch Dempsey redirected Landon Donovan's pass into the net.  
 On February 29, 2012, Dempsey scored the lone goal in an international friendly win against four time World champion Italy . Jozy Altidore assisted on the goal, allowing the United States to win for the first time against Italy in eleven games played since 1934.  
 Dempsey broke his own fastest-goal record in World Cup qualifying on September 7, scoring just 39 seconds into a 2–1 defeat against Jamaica in Kingston. During a qualifying match against Guatemala on October 16, 2012, Dempsey scored his 29th and 30th international goal, tying him with Brian McBride for third most goals scored for the United States national team. The goals helped the United States advance into the final qualifying stage for World Cup 2014 . 
 In March 2013, Dempsey was given the captain's armband by Jürgen Klinsmann for the important World Cup qualifying matches versus Costa Rica and Mexico . 
 On June 2, 2013, Dempsey scored two goals against Germany in a 4–3 win. The goals were his 34th and 35th overall for the national team, surpassing Eric Wynalda as second all-time top-goalscorer for the United States. 
 Style of play  
 A versatile, right-footed midfielder, Dempsey normally played on the right or up front as second striker for Tottenham, and on the left for the United States, with the ability to score from long distance. However, he has proven to be more of a threat the closer to goal he gets. His goals against Egypt and Spain in the Confederations Cup came almost immediately after being moved forward by a substitution from Bob Bradley . 
 Known for his toughness and resilience, Dempsey played two games for New England Revolution with a broken jaw in 2004 before the team trainer diagnosed it, and upon his return, he played through the pain of a sprained ankle. Despite usually playing in wide positions, he frequently scores close-range goals and has scored repeatedly with diving headers in crowded situations. 
 His tenacity in midfield combined with his audacious close control dribbling skills frequently results in opponents fouling him, and Dempsey has gained a reputation for fierce play. This has on several occasions lapsed into violent conduct. He was suspended by the New England Revolution for two weeks in March 2006 for a fist fight with teammate Joe Franchino during a practice game

 Personal life  
 Dempsey is married to Bethany Keegan Dempsey.  
 Music  
 One of Dempsey's passions outside of soccer is hip hop music . Using the alias "Deuce," he, along with fellow Texas rappers XO and the late Houston rapper Big Hawk from the Screwed Up Click, is featured rapping the song "Don't Tread" in a Nike soccer advertising campaign for the 2006 World Cup with the intention to showcase both the sport's working-class roots and the United States team ahead of the World Cup.  The song's video is dedicated to his sister Jennifer, who, at age 16, was suddenly struck with a fatal brain aneurysm . At Dempsey's request, the video ends with a shot of him placing a flower at her grave.
