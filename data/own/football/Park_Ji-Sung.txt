 Park Ji-Sung ( Hangul : 박 지 성 ; Hanja : 朴 智 星 ; Korean pronunciation:&#160;  
 Park began his football career in his native South Korea and played for the Myongji University team before moving to Japan to play for Kyoto Purple Sanga . After Park's national team manager Guus Hiddink moved back to the Netherlands to manage PSV Eindhoven, Park followed him to the Dutch side a year later. After PSV reached the semi-finals of the 2004–05 UEFA Champions League , Park's talents were recognised by Manchester United manager Alex Ferguson and he signed Park for a fee of around £4&#160;million in July 2005. In his time at Manchester United, Park won the Premier League four times and also won the 2007–08 UEFA Champions League and the 2008 FIFA Club World Cup . He moved to Queens Park Rangers in July 2012 after suffering a reduction in his number of appearances for Manchester United the previous season. However, an injury-interrupted season with QPR, combined with the club's relegation, led to Park rejoining PSV on loan for the 2013–14 season. 
 As a member of the South Korean national team, Park won 100 caps and scored 13 goals,

 Career  
 Early career  
 Although many sources report that he was born in the South Korean capital, Seoul , Park was actually born in Goheung , Jeollanam-do .  a satellite city 30 kilometres (19&#160;mi) south of Seoul. He began playing football during his fourth year of elementary school. During this time, Park was known as one of the greatest young talents in South Korea and was being looked at by a number of different clubs. He was well known for his excellent work rate , mesmerising dribbling and pinpoint passes. While in high school (March 1996 – February 1999), he helped his high school team win the national championship in 1998, though he was at that point rejected by a number of professional clubs and universities, due to his small stature, however, his fitness coach, Sam Y. Kim suggested Park should continue to pursue a career in football. He ended up playing for Myongji University after his high school coach strongly recommended him to the university coach. 
 From the winter vacation of his third high school year, he began to train with his university team as a soon to be member. A few weeks later, in January 1999, his university team was given the chance to train with the South Korean Olympics Team . After a splendid performance, he attracted the attention of Huh Jung-Moo , the coach of the Olympic Team and South Korean national team (October 1998 – November 2000). Thereafter he became a preliminary member of the Olympics Team, and finally a formal member of its squad . At 18 years old, it was believed that if Park had not been selected for the Under-23 Olympic team, he would have been selected for the under-20 team instead. This selection was so unexpected for Park and others that it was rumoured that Huh selected Park in response for Huh's defeat at a game of Go between Huh and the university coach.  
 On 5 April 2000, in a 2000 AFC Asian Cup qualification match against Laos , Park made his debut as a member of the national team, along with Lee Chun-Soo . In June 2000, while he was a national team member and a second year student at Myongji University, Kyoto Purple Sanga of Japan offered Park a contract and he took the offer though he was still a relative unknown. Park was the first instance of a relatively unknown Korean player being offered a contract by a Japanese club. 
 In September 2000, at the 2000 Summer Olympics , his Olympics team failed to advance to the knockout stage, and the Korea national football team replaced head coach Huh Jung-Moo with Guus Hiddink . 
 Kyoto Purple Sanga  
 In June 2000, Park signed with the Kyoto-based then J. League Division 2 side Kyoto Purple Sanga . In the spring of 2000, hearing that there was a rising star in Korea, Bunji Kimura , Sanga's coach at the time, visited Korea along with other scouts. In a practice game, the rising star did not attract their attention, whereas Park did. In an interview, Kimura said: 
 
 In a practice match, a player arrested our eyes. Despite his injuries, Park's performance was outstanding. Park played only about 20 minutes, however we could see his sense, physical strength, and his potential, so we accepted Park instead of the player we thought. This scout aroused a lot of criticism in Sanga because Park was unknown, to the point that I should resign.  
 
 In 2001, the club won the Division 2 title and were promoted to the first division . In 2002, Park led the team to the final of the Emperor's Cup , and in the final on 1 January 2003, he scored the equaliser with a header and assisted on Teruaki Kurobe 's winning goal.  The team went on to win the match 2–1 to become the Emperor's Cup champions for the first time in Sanga's history. This was Park's last game for Sanga. In January 2003, he left Sanga as Guus Hiddink invited him to play for PSV Eindhoven . 
 PSV Eindhoven  
 After the World Cup, Hiddink was appointed as manager of Dutch club PSV Eindhoven . In 2003, Park and South Korean teammate Lee Young-Pyo moved to PSV Eindhoven in order to play under their mentor and former national team coach. While Lee quickly became a fixture in PSV Eindhoven's starting line-up, Park struggled due to injuries.  
 However, by the end of 2003–04 season, Park had begun to adapt to the Netherlands, both on and off the field. In the 2004–05 season, the departure of Arjen Robben to Chelsea afforded Park more starting opportunities and he quickly proved his worth to the team. Along with Johann Vogel , DaMarcus Beasley and Dutchmen Mark van Bommel and Philip Cocu , Park formed the backbone of PSV Eindhoven's midfield play with his pace and passing.  
 Nevertheless, thanks to these strong performances, Park was chosen, along with Andriy Shevchenko , Adriano , Samuel Eto'o , and Ronaldinho as one of the nominees for the 2005 UEFA Best Forward award.  
 Manchester United

 In July 2005 , Park chose to join Sir Alex Ferguson 's Manchester United . Park signed for the Premier League side for £ 4&#160;million,  (the first was Dong Fangzhuo ). 
 Park became the first Asian to ever captain Manchester United when he took the armband from Ryan Giggs as he replaced him during a Champions League home group match against Lille on 18 October 2005.  
 In April 2007, Park was sent to America for surgery on a recurring knee injury, putting an end to his season.  Although sidelined by injury for most of the season, he still played in enough matches to become the first South Korean player to win the Premier League. 
 On 1 March 2008, Park scored his first league goal of the 2007–08 season after returning from his long-term injury against Fulham. His lack of appearances had caused much controversy in South Korea,  
 Early in the 2008–09 Premier League season, in an away match versus Chelsea, Park scored the only goal for United in a 1–1 draw on 21 September 2008, in a game which he also won the Man of the Match award.  On 15 April 2009, Manchester United advanced to semi-finals of the Champions League by defeating Porto 3–2 on aggregate. This made Park the only Asian player to be part of UEFA Champions League semi-finals on four different occasions.

 On 2 May 2009, Park verbally agreed to a new four-year £50,000-a-week deal at Manchester United, stating "I have no reason to move. I play at the best club in the world".  
 On 14 September 2009, Park signed a three-year contract extension with United, keeping him at the club until 2012. Ferguson said during the summer that he was always confident a deal would be done with Park, whose wages are estimated to be about £75,000 a week.  On 9 May 2010, Park netted on the final day of the season, scoring a close-range diving header against Stoke City to wrap up a 4–0 win.

 Park returned to the United team for the first time following the World Cup as he started against a League of Ireland XI in their final pre-season game on 4 August 2010. He marked this game with the first ever goal scored at the newly built Aviva Stadium , he then scored a second later on as United ended the game 7–1 winners.  He also scored a goal and set up the second goal for Anderson in the last match of the season against Blackpool. Park played in another Champions League Final, against Barcelona in 2011, which United lost 3–1. During the USA tour, Park scored in a 4–1 win against the New England Revolution and in a 7–0 win against Seattle Sounders. In the last USA tour game, which Manchester United won 4–0, Park was named the man of the match after scoring a goal on the stroke of half-time. 
 On 28 August 2011, Park scored the sixth goal in an 8–2 home win against Arsenal , shortly after coming on as a second half substitute. Park made his first start of the season in the Premier League in a 2–0 home win against Norwich City . Late on in the game he was involved in a neat one-two with Danny Welbeck in the creation of United's second goal of the day, which Welbeck finished. On 26 December 2011 Park scored an early goal in United's 5–0 home win against Wigan with a neat side foot finish from Patrice Evra 's cutback. He also won the penalty that wrapped up the win which Dimitar Berbatov scored to complete his hat-trick. In an FA Cup fourth round clash against Liverpool, Park scored an equalising goal with a low finish from a Rafael cross to make it 1–1; however, United went on to lose the tie. 
 On 5 February 2012, Park made his 200th appearance for Manchester United by coming on as a substitute in the 86th minute against Chelsea. He became the 92nd player in the history of the club to reach the milestone. On 23 February 2012, Park captained Manchester United for the first time from the beginning of a match in a 2–1 home defeat to Ajax in the Europa League. Although the match ended in a defeat, United still advanced to the Round of 16 with a 3–2 aggregate score. On 30 April 2012, Park played in the Manchester derby, in a game that was widely perceived as crucial to Manchester United's title defence. Manchester United lost the game 0–1 and Manchester City went on to win the Premier League title. 
 Queens Park Rangers  
 Having received less first-team football in his last season at Manchester United, Park moved to Queens Park Rangers for an undisclosed fee on 9 July 2012, signing a two-year contract with the Hoops.  
 Park's first season with QPR was largely unsuccessful. Despite initially being made club captain, a combination of injuries and lack of form meant that Park was unable to have the kind of impact that was expected after his signing from Manchester United. Park finished the season with only 20 Premier League appearances and no goals, as QPR were relegated from the top flight of English football. 
 Return to PSV  
 With QPR no longer in the top flight, Park rejoined PSV Eindhoven on loan for the 2013–14 season. The deal was completed on 8 August 2013, but Park's work permit application delayed his first game back for the club.

 Park began his international career for South Korea as a 19-year-old defensive midfielder and made his first appearance selection during 2000 Sydney Olympics U-23 regional qualifier. Selected by then manager, Huh Jung-Moo , for the 2000 Sydney Olympics, Park was unable to improve or show potential. However, when Guus Hiddink became the head coach of South Korea, Park's position was shifted to that of a winger ; since then, he has become a versatile player able to play in a variety of positions: central, right and left midfield, as well as wing-forward. 
 2002 FIFA World Cup  
 Park scored a memorable goal during the 2002 World Cup . During the group stages South Korea had won their first game against Poland

 2010 FIFA World Cup  
 On 11 October 2008, he captained South Korea for the first time in a friendly against Uzbekistan . Korea won 3–0. He was the skipper for the remainder of the qualification campaign for the 2010 FIFA World Cup and was top scorer, with 5 goals. One of his goals was against Iran in Seoul, beating 2 defenders then scored with his left foot. South Korea advanced to the finals without a single defeat. On 12 June 2010, Park netted in his third consecutive World Cup, scoring the second goal in South Korea's 2–0 win over Greece in their first group match .

 Style of play  
 Park received much acclaim at Manchester United for his work rate and energy which saw him deployed all over the midfield, including in the middle of the pitch and on both wings, where he operates as a "defensive winger".
