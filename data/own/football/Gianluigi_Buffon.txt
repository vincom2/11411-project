 Club career  
 Youth career and beginnings at Parma  
 Buffon began his career with the youth system of Parma in 1991 at the age of 13.  
 He graduated from the youth squad in 1995 and at the age of 17, he made his Serie A debut for Parma , keeping a clean sheet in a 0–0 home draw against eventual Serie A Champions Milan on 19 November 1995.  He went on to make eight more first team appearances that season as well as one appearance in the Coppa Italia as Parma were eliminated in the second round. Parma finished in sixth place in Serie A that season, qualifying for the UEFA Cup . Parma also reached the quarter-finals of the 1995–96 European Cup Winners' Cup that season, although Buffon did not make any appearances in that tournament. 
 1996–2001: Making the starting eleven, early success and recognition  
 In the 1996–97 Serie A season , his second full season with the club, Buffon was named as the starting goalkeeper ahead of Luca Bucci and would eventually go on to make well over 200 appearances for Parma in all competitions during his time at the club. Parma finished the 1996–97 season as runners-up to Serie A Champions Juventus , allowing them to qualify for the UEFA Champions League the following season. Buffon conceded 17 goals in 27 appearances. Parma were once again eliminated in the second round of the Coppa Italia and in the first round of the UEFA Cup that season. 
 In the 1997–98 season , Parma finished in fifth place in Serie A and reached the Coppa Italia semi-finals, whilst they were knocked out in the group stage of the Champions League , finishing second in their group to defending champions Borussia Dortmund . 
 In his fourth season with the club, Buffon won his first European trophy, the UEFA Cup ,  
 In the following season , he won his first Supercoppa Italiana title against Serie A Champions Milan and Parma finished the Serie A season in fourth place, tied with Inter for the final remaining Champions League spot. Parma however lost to Inter on aggregate in the playoff matches failing to qualify for the Champions League. They were knocked out in the round of 16 of both the UEFA Cup and the Coppa Italia that season. 
 In the 2000–01 season , Buffon helped lead Parma to another Coppa Italia Final , in which they were defeated by Fiorentina . They were eliminated in the third round of the UEFA Cup that season. Parma also finished the season in fourth place for the third consecutive season, which allowed them to go through to the Champions League qualifying round. Buffon was voted Serie A Goalkeeper of the Year for the second time in his career. Buffon also placed third in the IFFHS Goalkeeper of the year award.  
 In the summer of 2001, Buffon was sold to Juventus for a world-record goalkeeper's transfer fee of 100 billion lire , (€51,645,690)  
 Juventus  
 2001–2004: Dominance under Lippi  
 Buffon transferred from Parma to Juventus in the summer of 2001 for €51 million and was handed the number 1 shirt as the starting goalkeeper, replacing former keeper Edwin Van der Sar , who had been sold to Fulham .  
 In his first season with Juventus, Buffon appeared in 45 official matches, helping his team to the Serie A title, as Juventus finished the season with the best defence in Italy, with Buffon only conceding 22 goals in 34 matches. Juventus also finished as runners-up in the Coppa Italia that season to Buffon's former club Parma. Juventus were, however, eliminated in the second group stage of the UEFA Champions League . Buffon was awarded his third Serie A Goalkeeper of the Year Award at the end of the season for his performances. 
 At the beginning of the 2002–03 season, Juventus won the 2002 Supercoppa Italiana against Parma, avenging the Coppa Italia final defeat of the previous season. Buffon had a dominant year, totalling 47 appearances in all competitions, of which 32 were in Serie A that season . He helped Juventus to the UEFA Champions League Final , only for his team to lose in a penalty shoot-out to Milan after a 0–0 draw. Buffon managed to save two penalties, but Milan won the shootout 3–2.  
 Buffon began the 2003–04 season by avenging the Champions League final loss of the previous season as Juventus defeated Milan on penalties in the 2003 Supercoppa Italiana , with Buffon saving a penalty in the shootout. Juventus were eliminated in the round of 16 of the Champions League that season by Deportivo La Coruña and finished the Serie A season in a disappointing 3rd place, although they managed to reach the Coppa Italia Final , losing to Lazio . He was named by Pelé as one of the top 125 greatest living footballers in March 2004 and was named Serie A Goalkeeper of the Year for the fifth time. He was once again elected as the Goalkeeper for the UEFA Team of the Year and as the IFFHS Goalkeeper of the Year.  
 2004–2006: Capello, Calciopoli and relegation  
 In the summer of 2004, Lippi left Juventus to take charge of the Italian National Team and was replaced by manager Fabio Capello . In his fourth season with the club, Buffon made 38 appearances in Serie A and 48 in all competitions that season as he won his third Serie A title in four years with Juventus, winning once again the Serie A Goalkeeper of the Year award for the sixth time in his career. Juventus were knocked out in the quarter-finals of the Champions League against eventual winners Liverpool and in the round of 16 of the Coppa Italia . 
 In August 2005, Buffon collided with Milan attacking-midfielder Kaká during the annual pre-season Trofeo Luigi Berlusconi match and suffered a dislocated shoulder, requiring surgery.

 On 12 May 2006, several players, including Buffon, were accused of participating in illegal betting on Serie A matches. Buffon voluntarily co-operated, allowing himself to be interrogated by Turin magistrates. While admitting that he did place bets on sporting matches (until regulations went into effect in late 2005, banning players from doing so), he vehemently denied placing wagers on Italian football matches. Despite initial concerns that he had jeopardised his chance of playing for Italy in the 2006 FIFA World Cup , he was officially named Italy's starting goalkeeper on 15 May and helped lead Italy to win their fourth title.  
 2007–2010: Serie B champions and return to Serie A  
 After Juventus won the Serie B title in the 2006–07 season ,  
 Buffon was a key player for Juventus in the 2007–08 Serie A season, as he helped Juventus to a third place finish as well as UEFA Champions League qualification in their first season back in the top flight. Juventus lost to runners-up Inter in the Coppa Italia quarter-finals. Buffon was named Serie A Goalkeeper of the Year for the eighth time in his career. 
 In 2008–09 Serie A , Buffon was once again sidelined by several injuries, having problems with his back but principally a bad groin strain and a pulled muscle.  He admitted he was disappointed with the current results, but assured that he had no intention of leaving. After a discussion with management, he said he was reassured about the future of Juventus and signed a year extension to 2013. Buffon and Juventus finished the season on a high note however, with two victories, allowing them to finish in second place, behind Inter . They were knocked out of the Coppa Italia semi-finals by eventual champions Lazio and of the UEFA Champions League in the Round of 16 by semi-finalists Chelsea . 
 Juventus and Buffon began the 2009–10 Serie A season strongly, although the squad suffered a severe dip in form as they were eliminated from the UEFA Champions League , finishing third in their group. They were subsequently eliminated in the Round of 16 of the Europa League against Fulham . Juventus were knocked out in the Quarter Finals of the Coppa Italia to eventual Champions Inter and finished the Serie A season in a disappointing seventh place, meaning that they had to qualify for the 2010–11 Europa League through the playoff round. Buffon was often sidelined that season, having endured several recurring injuries.  
 Buffon did not play for the first half of the 2010–11 Serie A season as he was recovering from surgery from an injury from the World Cup . His new deputy, Marco Storari, replaced him throughout the injury.  Juventus were knocked out of the Europa League group stage with 6 draws, the Coppa Italia in the quarter finals and finished the Serie A season in seventh place, failing to qualify for Europe for the first time since the 1990–91 Season . 
 2011–present: The Conte era and the return to victory  
 During 2011–12 Juventus were once again a dominating force in Serie A. Buffon made numerous notable and important saves, including stopping a penalty kick from Francesco Totti , which impeded Roma from taking the lead in an eventual 1–1 draw in Rome .  Juventus also made the Coppa Italia Final that season, although Buffon did not play in this competition, allowing second keeper Marco Storari to compete for the trophy. Juventus were runners-up to Napoli in the final.

 On 11 August 2012, Buffon lifted his first trophy as the new Juventus captain , following Alessandro Del Piero 's departure. Juventus defeated Napoli 4–2 in extra time in the 2012 Supercoppa Italiana Final in Beijing. Buffon suffered a minor injury and was not able to partake in the first Serie A match of the 2012–13 season against Parma on 25 August 2012.  
 On 23 January 2013, Buffon signed a contract extension with Juventus, keeping him at the club until 2015.  Juventus retained their Serie A title that season, and finished the league once again with the least beaten defence, with Buffon conceding just 19 goals. The Serie A victory meant that Buffon lifted the Serie A trophy as captain for the first time, as Alessandro Del Piero had left Juventus at the end of the previous season. Juventus were eliminated in the semifinals of the Coppa Italia to winners Lazio , and in the quarter-finals of the Champions League to winners Bayern Munich . 
 On the 18th of August, 2013, Juventus began the 2013–14 season by defending their Supercoppa Italiana title, at the Stadio Olimpico , in Rome. Juventus defeated Coppa Italia winners Lazio 4–0, with Buffon keeping a clean sheet in the competition for the first time. Buffon was praised for his goalkeeping, making several difficult and important saves.

 Youth career, early call-ups and Euro 2000 qualification  
 Buffon was a member of Italy 's 1996 UEFA under-21 championship winning squad.  
 Buffon was awarded his first cap for Italy's senior team under Cesare Maldini on 29 October 1997, at the age of nineteen, as an injury replacement for Gianluca Pagliuca during the first leg of the crucial 1998 World Cup qualification play-off against Russia played in Moscow . Buffon made notable saves under snowy conditions in an important 1–1 away draw, only being beaten by an own goal by Fabio Cannavaro .  The result helped Italy to qualify for the upcoming World Cup. He was a member of the squad for the 1998 World Cup finals, initially as the third choice goalkeeper. After Peruzzi's injury, he was promoted to second choice keeper, with Toldo being called up as the third choice keeper, but Buffon did not play a single game as Pagliuca remained first choice throughout the tournament. Italy were eliminated in the Quarter finals on penalties to hosts and eventual 1998 World Cup Champions France. 
 Buffon became the first choice goalkeeper during the Euro 2000 qualifying campaign and was due to start in goal during the finals under manager and former Italy goalkeeping legend Dino Zoff , but he broke his hand in a warm up match against Norway , just a few days before Italy's opening match against Turkey . His starting place was taken by backup goalkeeper Francesco Toldo and Christian Abbiati was called up as a replacement third keeper, with Francesco Antonioli being promoted to second keeper. Italy reached the final of the tournament, losing once again to France on a golden goal in extra time, with the match ending 2–1.

 Trapattoni era: World Cup and European Championship debut  
 Toldo's impressive performances at Euro 2000 (which included a match winning performance in the semi-final against hosts the Netherlands ;  as Italy qualified with an unbeaten record. 
 Buffon played every minute of Italy's 2002 World Cup campaign,  keeping a clean-sheet in the opening match against Ecuador , and saving a controversial penalty against co-hosts South Korea in the Round of 16, which was not enough to stop the under-performing side from being eliminated by a golden goal in extra time. He also featured in every match in 2004 European Championships , keeping a clean-sheet against Denmark, though Italy, despite not losing a match, once again underperformed, and were eliminated in the first round on direct encounters following a three way 5 point tie with Sweden and Denmark . 
 Lippi era: 2006 world champion  
 Buffon was once again the first choice goalkeeper under his former Juventus coach, and Trapattoni's replacement, Marcello Lippi , as Italy finished first in their 2006 World Cup Qualifying group. 
 During the 2006 World Cup finals, Buffon was in stunning form, as he conceded a World Cup record two goals,  Buffon recorded five clean sheets in the 2006 FIFA World Cup and has a career total of six. Buffon also finished second to compatriot Cannavaro in the 2006 Ballon d'Or and 8th in the FIFA World Player of the Year for his performances that season and was selected to be the goalkeeper for the 2006 FIFPro World XI. 
 After the World Cup victory: Donadoni, and Lippi's return  
 Buffon was named Italy captain under Donadoni for Euro 2008 after incumbent Fabio Cannavaro was ruled out of the tournament due to injury. In the second game of the group stage against Romania on 13 June, he saved an 81st minute penalty from Adrian Mutu as the match ended 1–1 to keep Italy's hopes alive. Buffon kept a clean sheet against France in the final group game, helping Italy to a 2–0 win, allowing them to advance to the quarter-finals. Italy were eliminated in the quarter-finals nine days later, when a 0–0 draw after extra-time led to a 4–2 penalty shootout loss to eventual champions Spain . Buffon saved one penalty in the shootout  and was elected to be part of the team of the tournament. 
 Upon Lippi 's return, Buffon was confirmed as the starting keeper. He played all three group matches during Italy's disappointing 2009 Confederations Cup Campaign in South Africa, in which they finished third in their group in three-way three point tie. He retained his position and earned his 100th cap on 14 November 2009 in a friendly match against the Netherlands.  
 In the 2010 World Cup , Buffon was replaced at half-time in Italy's 1–1 draw in their opening group stage match against Paraguay after he had a problem with his sciatic nerve .  Italy disappointed and failed to win a match. They were eliminated from the World Cup, finishing last in their group with two points. Lippi was dismissed after the World Cup. 
 Prandelli era: Italy captain and Euro 2012 runner-up  
 After the international retirement of Cannavaro, Buffon became the new captain of the national team under the new manager Cesare Prandelli . On 9 February 2011, after recovering from a back injury, Buffon played his first game as official captain in the friendly match against Germany played in Dortmund . On the 6th of September, 2011, after a 1–0 Italy win over Slovenia , Buffon established the new record for most minutes without conceding a goal in European Championship Qualifying matches, going 644 minutes without conceding a goal.  The win also allowed Italy to qualify for Euro 2012 with two qualifying group matches left. On 15 November 2011, in a friendly match against Uruguay , Buffon surpassed Dino Zoff 's number of caps for Italy (112), putting him behind only the retired former Italy captains Fabio Cannavaro and Paolo Maldini . He was subsequently selected as Italy's starting goalkeeper and captain for Euro 2012, along with six other Juventus players , after leading Italy as captain to qualify for the tournament undefeated in their group and in official competitive matches under Prandelli, only having conceded 2 goals during the qualifying group stage.

 At UEFA Euro 2012 Buffon acted as captain during the entire tournament. He kept a clean-sheet against the Republic of Ireland in the third group-stage match, and against England , saving a crucial penalty from Ashley Cole in the quarterfinal shootout, in which he was elected man of the match. In the semi-final match against Germany , Buffon made several important saves, only being beaten by a penalty by Mesut Özil in the 92nd minute. Italy won the match 2–1 and advanced to the final against defending European and World Champions Spain , with whom Italy had drawn 1–1 in the opening group stage match, only having conceded 3 goals. The semi-final victory automatically qualified Italy for the 2013 Confederations Cup regardless of the result in the final, since Spain had previously won the 2010 World Cup. Italy were beaten 4–0 in the final as Spain claimed a record third consecutive major trophy, and their second consecutive European Championship title. Buffon was once again chosen to be part of the team of the tournament for his performances.  
 World Cup 2014 Qualifying and 2013 Confederations Cup under Prandelli  
 On the 26th of March, 2013, in a 2014 World Cup qualifying match against Malta , Buffon earned his 126th cap for Italy, equaling azzurri legend Paolo Maldini's number of caps for the national team. In the same match, Buffon saved a penalty by Michael Mifsud, which he had originally conceded, helping Italy to a 0–2 away win.  This put him in second place only behind Fabio Cannavaro, with 136 caps for Italy. 
 Buffon was included in the Italian squad for the 2013 FIFA Confederations Cup in Brazil and played in every match of the tournament as captain. On 16 June 2013, Buffon was in goal for Italy in the opening game against Mexico in a 2–1 win for the Italians, where he was beaten only by a Javier Hernandez penalty. In the next game on 19 June 2013, against Japan in a 4–3 win for Italy, the referee awarded Japan a penalty in the 20th minute of the first half, when he declared that Shinji Okazaki had been brought down by Buffon after a misplaced back pass by De Sciglio ; Buffon received a yellow card. The eventual 4–3 win allowed Italy to progress to the semifinals of the competition for the first time, regardless of the result of the final group match against eventual winners Brazil , which ended in a 4–2 loss to Italy. Italy faced Spain in the semi-final, in a rematch of the European Championship Final of the previous year , but lost 7–6 in the resulting penalty shootout, after a full-time score of 0–0. Although both Buffon and Casillas had managed to keep a clean sheet throughout the match, neither keeper was able to stop a penalty in the shootout; the lone miss, by Buffon's Juventus team mate Leonardo Bonucci , was hit over the crossbar. In the 3rd-place match, Italy defeated Uruguay by 3–2 in the penalty shootout after a 2–2 deadlock after extra time. Buffon saved three penalty shots; those taken by Diego Forlán , Juventus team mate Martín Cáceres and Walter Gargano . However, despite helping Italy to a bronze medal finish, Buffon did not receive the man of the match award. It was awarded to Uruguayan Edinson Cavani , who had scored both of Uruguay's goals in the match.  Buffon also missed out on winning the Golden Glove award for the best goalkeeper of the tournament, which was given to Brazil goalkeeper and 2013 Confederations Cup winner Julio Cesar . 
 On the 6th of September, 2013, Buffon earned his 135th cap for Italy in the 2014 World Cup Qualifier against Bulgaria . This cap put him at only one cap from record appearance holder Fabio Cannavaro . Buffon kept a clean sheet for Italy in the 1–0 win and was praised, in particular by the media and Italy manager Cesare Prandelli , for making three important and difficult saves, earning a man of the match award. The win allowed Italy to move seven points clear in their qualifying group, needing only three more points to qualify for the 2014 World Cup .  
 Style of play and reputation  
 Buffon is widely considered by experts to be one of the most dominant and successful goalkeepers in history, having won numerous, prestigious individual and team awards, on several occasions. These include the UEFA Goalkeeper and UEFA Club Footballer of the Year , the IFFHS and Serie A Goalkeeper of the Year Awards and the Yashin Award after his 2006 World Cup Victory with Italy . He has also won the FIFPro World XI Goalkeeper award and placed second in the 2006 Ballon d'Or .  
 Buffon has been described as "an agile, commanding shot-stopper who is hugely experienced at the highest level" and "an accomplished and well respected keeper"  
 Controversy  
 While at Parma, Buffon's decision to wear the number 88 shirt, rather than his previous number 1 shirt, for the 2000–01 season caused controversy in Italy. However, Buffon claimed to be unaware of the number's neo-Nazi connotations, stating that 88 represented four balls, which the wise man possesses as symbols of the character and attributes of a person.  
 Personal life  
 Gianluigi Buffon was born into a family of Italian athletes. His mother, Maria Stella, was a discus thrower and his father, Adriano, was a weightlifter . Buffon’s two sisters, Veronica and Guendalina, played volleyball for the Italian National Volleyball Team , and his uncle, Dante Masocco, was a basketball player in Serie A1, who also represented the National Team.
