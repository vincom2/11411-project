 Early life 
 Beckham was born at Whipps Cross University Hospital in Leytonstone , London, England.  
 His parents were fanatical Manchester United supporters who would frequently travel to Old Trafford from London to attend the team's home matches. David inherited his parents' love of Manchester United, and his main sporting passion was football. He attended one of Bobby Charlton 's football schools in Manchester and won the chance to take part in a training session at FC Barcelona , as part of a talent competition. He played for a local youth team called the Ridgeway Rovers&#160;– coached by his father, Stuart Underwood and Steve Kirby. Beckham was a Manchester United mascot for a match against West Ham United in 1986. Young Beckham had trials with his local club Leyton Orient , Norwich City and attended Tottenham Hotspur 's school of excellence. Tottenham Hotspur was the first club he played for. During a two-year period in which Beckham played for Brimsdown Rovers ' youth team, he was named Under-15 Player of the Year in 1990.  He also attended Bradenton Preparatory Academy, but signed schoolboy forms at Manchester United on his 14th birthday, and subsequently signed a Youth Training Scheme contract on 8 July 1991. 
 Club career 
 Manchester United 
 Beckham was part of a group of young players at the club who guided the club to win the FA Youth Cup in May 1992, with Beckham scoring in the second leg  of the final against Crystal Palace . He made his first appearance for United's first-team that year, as a substitute in a League Cup match against Brighton &amp; Hove Albion , and signed his first professional contract shortly afterwards. United reached the final of the Youth Cup again the following year, with Beckham playing in their defeat by Leeds United , and he won another medal in 1994 when the club's reserve team won their league, although he did not play in any first team games that season. 
 On 7 December 1994, Beckham made his UEFA Champions League debut, scoring a goal in a 4–0 victory at home to Galatasaray in the final game of the group stage. However, this victory was of little use as they finished third out of four in their group behind FC Barcelona on goal difference. 
 Preston North End (loan) 
 He then went to Preston North End on loan for part of the 1994–95 season to get some first team experience. He impressed, scoring two goals in five appearances, notably scoring directly from a corner kick .  
 Return to Manchester United 
 Beckham returned to Manchester and finally made his Premier League debut for Manchester United on 2 April 1995, in a goal-less draw against Leeds United . He played four times for United in the league that season, as they finished second behind Blackburn Rovers and missed a third successive Premier League title by a single point. He was not in the squad for United's FA Cup final clash with Everton on 20 May, which they lost 1–0 and were left without a major trophy for the first time since 1989. 
 United manager Sir Alex Ferguson had a great deal of confidence in the club's young players. Beckham was part of a group of young talents Ferguson brought into United in the 1990s (known as " Fergie's Fledglings "), which included Nicky Butt and Gary and Phil Neville . When experienced players Paul Ince , Mark Hughes , and Andrei Kanchelskis left the club after the end of the 1994–95 season, his decision to let youth team players replace them instead of buying star players from other clubs (United had been linked with moves for players including Darren Anderton , Marc Overmars , and Roberto Baggio , but no major signings were made that summer), drew a great deal of criticism. The criticism increased when United started the season with a 3–1 defeat at Aston Villa ,  with Beckham scoring United's only goal of the game; however, United won their next five matches and the young players performed well. 
 Beckham swiftly established himself as United's right-sided midfielder (rather than a right-winger in the style of his predecessor Andrei Kanchelskis) and helped them to win the Premier League title and FA Cup double that season, scoring the winner in the semi-final against Chelsea and also provided the corner that Eric Cantona scored from in the FA Cup Final. Beckham's first title medal had, for a while, looked like it would not be coming that season, as United were still 10 points adrift of leaders Newcastle United at the turn of the new year, but Beckham and his team-mates had overhauled the Tynesiders at the top of the league by mid March and they remained top until the end of the season. 
 Despite playing regularly (and to a consistently high standard) for Manchester United, Beckham did not break into the England squad before Euro 96 .  
 At the beginning of the 1996–97 season David Beckham was given the number 10 shirt that had most recently been worn by Mark Hughes. On 17 August 1996 (the first day of the Premier League season), Beckham became something of a household name when he scored a spectacular goal in a match against Wimbledon . With United leading 2–0, Beckham noticed that Wimbledon's goalkeeper Neil Sullivan was standing a long way out of his goal, and hit a shot from the halfway line that floated over the goalkeeper and into the net.  
 On 18 May 1997, Eric Cantona retired as a player and left the coveted number 7 shirt free, and with Teddy Sheringham arriving from Tottenham Hotspur as Cantona's successor, Beckham left his number 10 shirt for Sheringham and picked up the iconic number 7 jersey, famously worn by Johnny Berry , Steve Coppell , Bryan Robson , and Eric Cantona , and subsequently by Cristiano Ronaldo , Michael Owen and Antonio Valencia . 
 United started the 1997–98 season well but erratic performances in the second half of the season saw United finish second behind Arsenal .  
 In the 1998–99 season , he was part of the United team that won The Treble of the Premier League, FA Cup and Champions League , a unique feat in English football. There had been speculation that the criticism that he had received after being sent off in the World Cup would lead to him leaving England, but he decided to stay at Manchester United. 
 To ensure they would win the Premier League title, United needed to win their final league match of the season, at home to Tottenham Hotspur (with reports suggesting that the opposition would allow themselves to be easily beaten to prevent their deadly local rivals Arsenal from retaining the title), but Tottenham took an early lead in the match. Beckham scored the equaliser and United went on to win the match and the league. 
 Beckham played centre-midfield in United's win over Bayern Munich in the 1999 UEFA Champions League Final , since United's first string centre-midfielders Paul Scholes and Roy Keane were suspended for the match. United were losing the match 1–0 at the end of normal time, but won the trophy by scoring two goals in injury time. Both of the goals came from corners taken by Beckham. Those crucial assists, coupled with great performances over the rest of the season, led to him finishing runner up to Rivaldo for 1999's European Footballer of the Year and FIFA World Player of the Year awards. 
 Despite Beckham's achievements in the 1998–99 season, he was still unpopular among some opposition fans and journalists, and he was criticised after being sent off for a deliberate foul in Manchester United's World Club Championship match against Necaxa . It was suggested in the press that his wife was a bad influence on him, and that it might be in United's interests to sell him,  but his manager publicly backed him and he stayed at the club. During the 1999–2000 season, there was a talk of a transfer to Juventus in Italy, but this never happened. 
 Beckham helped United retain the Premier League title in 1999–2000 by an 18-point margin – after being pushed by Arsenal and Leeds United for much of the season, United won their final 11 league games of the season, with Beckham scoring five goals during this fantastic run of form. He managed six league goals that season, and scored eight goals in all competitions. 
 By the early 2000s, the relationship between Ferguson and Beckham had begun to deteriorate, possibly as a result of Beckham's fame and commitments away from football. In 2000, Beckham was given permission to miss training to look after his son Brooklyn, who had gastroenteritis , but Ferguson was furious when Victoria Beckham was photographed at a London Fashion Week event on the same night, claiming that Beckham would have been able to train if Victoria had looked after Brooklyn that day. He responded by fining Beckham the maximum amount that was permitted (two weeks' wages – then £50,000) and dropping him for a crucial match against United's rivals Leeds United . He later criticised Beckham for this in his autobiography, claiming he had not been "fair to his teammates"  Beckham had a good season for his club, though, and helped United to win the Premier League by a record margin. 
 
 "He was never a problem until he got married. He used to go into work with the academy coaches at night time, he was a fantastic young lad. Getting married into that entertainment scene was a difficult thing – from that moment, his life was never going to be the same. He is such a big celebrity, football is only a small part."' – Alex Ferguson speaking about Beckham's marriage in 2007.  
 
 He was a key player in United's third successive league title in 2000–01 – only the fourth time that any club had achieved three league titles in a row. He scored nine goals that season, all in the Premier League. 
 On 10 April 2002, Beckham was injured during a Champions League match against Deportivo La Coruña , breaking the second metatarsal bone in his left foot. There was speculation in the British media that the injury might have been caused deliberately, as the player who had injured Beckham was Argentine Aldo Duscher , and England and Argentina were due to meet in that year's World Cup.  Despite the injury, 2001–02 was arguably Beckham's best season as a United player; he scored 11 goals in 28 league games, and a total of 16 goals in 42 games in all competitions, the best tally of his career. 
 Following an injury early in the 2002–03 season , Beckham was unable to regain his place on the Manchester United team, with Ole Gunnar Solskjær having replaced him on the right side of midfield. His relationship with his manager deteriorated further on 15 February 2003 when, in the changing room following an FA Cup defeat to Arsenal, a furious Alex Ferguson threw  Although the team had started the season badly, their results improved greatly from December onwards and they won the league, with Beckham managing a total of 11 goals in 52 games in all competitions. 
 He was still a first-choice player for England, however, and was appointed an Officer of the Most Excellent Order of the British Empire (OBE) for services to football on 13 June 2003.  
 Beckham had made 265 Premier league appearances for United and scored 61 goals. He also made 81 Champions league appearances, scoring 15 goals. Beckham won six Premier League titles, two FA Cups, one European Cup , one Intercontinental Cup, and one FA Youth Cup in the space of 12 years. By this stage, he was their joint second longest serving player behind Ryan Giggs (having joined them at the same time as Nicky Butt , Gary Neville and Paul Scholes ). 
 Real Madrid

 As the summer 2003 transfer window approached, Manchester United appeared keen to sell Beckham to Barcelona  
 In the week before Beckham presentation, Real named Carlos Queiroz as their new head coach, meaning that Beckham got reunited with a familiar face upon arriving to Madrid since Queiroz spent the previous season as Alex Ferguson's assistant at Manchester United. In late July 2003, the club went on a tour of the Far East as part of the pre-season training, but also to cash in on Beckham's huge marketing appeal in Asia where he enjoyed tremendous following. Real's brand recognition in that part of the globe was already well established as the club made financially successful trips to Asia during previous off-seasons, however the presence of global marketing icon such as Beckham made this particular tour a financial smash for los Merengues .  
 Shortly after his Real switch, Beckham also ended his relationship with agent Tony Stephens of SFX Europe who had guided him through his career up until this point, including helping to engineer Beckham's move from Manchester to Madrid. Beckham signed on with Simon Fuller and his company 19 Entertainment that already managed the career of David's wife Victoria.  
 In late August 2003, Real Madrid won the Spanish Super Cup over two legs versus RCD Mallorca , with Beckham scoring the final goal in a 3–0 return leg win at home, thus setting the stage for the start of the league season. Playing on a star-laden team along with Zinedine Zidane , Ronaldo , Luis Figo , Roberto Carlos , Raúl, Iker Casillas , etc., Beckham did not require much time to settle in, scoring five times in his first 16 matches (including a goal less than three minutes into his La Liga debut). Queiroz mostly favoured the adaptable 5–3–2 formation with two fullbacks Michel Salgado and Roberto Carlos often joining the attack down the wings, while Beckham quickly found a regular playing spot on the right of the three-man midfield alongside Zidane and Figo.  
 Real Madrid were runners-up in the Copa del Rey , were knocked out of the UEFA Champions League at the quarter-final stage and finished the league season in fourth place, meaning the team, whose president Pérez expected them to win either the Spanish league or the Champions League each season, did not match expectations. 
 In July 2004, while Beckham was in pre-season training in Spain, an intruder scaled a wall at the Beckham home while carrying a can of petrol . Victoria and their children were in the house at the time, but security guards apprehended the man before he reached the house.  
 The league season began with new head coach José Antonio Camacho behind the bench, but he ended up lasting only three matches, handing in his resignation as Real dropped to eighth spot in the La Liga standings. Camacho's assistant Mariano García Remón took over on temporary basis as Real leadership scrambled to find a permanent replacement. Beckham made more headlines on 9 October 2004 when he admitted intentionally fouling Ben Thatcher in an England match against Wales to get himself booked. Beckham was due to receive a one-match suspension for his next caution , and had picked up an injury, which he knew would keep him out of England's next match, so he deliberately fouled Thatcher to serve his suspension in a match that he would have had to miss anyway. The Football Association asked Beckham for an explanation of his actions and he admitted that he had "made a mistake" and apologised.  He was sent off shortly afterwards, this time in a league match for Real Madrid against Valencia . Having received a yellow card , he was judged to have sarcastically applauded the referee and was given a second yellow card, causing an automatic dismissal, although the suspension was cancelled on appeal two days later. 
 By Christmas 2004, with the team sitting in second league spot, García Remón was gone as Vanderlei Luxemburgo became the new head coach. However, the well-traveled Brazilian failed to inspire the team to the title as Real again finished the season in the runner-up spot. 
 On 3 December 2005, Beckham was sent off for the third time that season in a league match against Getafe CF . One day later Luxemburgo got the axe and was replaced with Juan Ramón López Caro . By the end of that season, Beckham led La Liga in number of assists. 
 
 
 
  
Warming up with Real Madrid in August 2006 
 
 
 During the season, Beckham established football academies in Los Angeles and east London and he was named a judge for the 2006 British Book Awards.  Real Madrid finished second to Barcelona in the 2005–06 La Liga, albeit with a large 12-point gap, and reached the last 16 only in the Champions League after losing to Arsenal . The season also marked the end of an era for the club as Pérez resigned his president post in January 2006 with Vicente Boluda named as replacement on interim basis until the end of the season. 
 The summer 2006 off-season marked a turbulent time as club president elections were held. Ramón Calderón became the new Real president. As expected, none of the club officials that served under the previous president were kept, including head coach López Caro. 
 Initially out of favour with newly arrived head coach Fabio Capello , Beckham started only a few games at the beginning of the season, as the speedier José Antonio Reyes was normally preferred on the right wing. In the first nine matches Beckham started, Real lost seven. 
 On 10 January 2007, after prolonged contract negotiations, Real Madrid's sporting director Predrag Mijatović announced that Beckham would not remain at Real Madrid after the end of the season. However, he later claimed that he was mistranslated and that he actually said that Beckham's contract had not yet been renewed.  
 On 11 January 2007, Beckham announced that he had signed a five-year deal to play for Los Angeles Galaxy beginning 1 July 2007. On 13 January 2007, Fabio Capello said that Beckham had played his last game for Real Madrid, although he would continue to train with the team.  
 However, about a month later, Capello backtracked on his earlier statement, allowing Beckham to rejoin the team for the match against Real Sociedad on 10 February 2007. The player immediately repaid his head coach's trust by scoring the equalising goal from a 27-yard free kick as Real Madrid eventually recorded a 2–1 victory.  In his final UEFA Champions League appearance for the club, Real Madrid were knocked out of the competition by Bayern Munich at the round-of-16 stage (on the away goals rule) on 7 March 2007. The return leg against Bayern was Beckham's 103rd match in the Champions League, at the time placing him third on the all-time appearances list in the competition. 
 
 
 
  
Beckham's last season in Real Madrid 
 
 
 On 17 June 2007, the last day of the La Liga season, Beckham started in his final match for the club, a 3–1 win over RCD Mallorca , which saw them clinch the title from Barcelona. With Real down 0–1 Beckham limped off the field and was replaced by José Antonio Reyes who scored two goals leading the team to that season's La Liga title , their first since Beckham had signed with them and 30th overall in club's history. Although Real and Barca both finished level on points, Madrid took the title because of superior head-to-head record, capping a remarkable six-month turnaround for Beckham. With his wife and children along with celebrity friends Tom Cruise and Katie Holmes watching from a luxury box at Bernabeu Stadium, it was only Beckham's second piece of silverware since he joined the famous club. 
 Towards the end of the season, as Beckham was getting back into Capello's good books after successfully fighting his way back into the first team, Real Madrid announced they would try to untie his transfer to LA Galaxy, but were ultimately unsuccessful.  
 A month after the conclusion of Beckham's Real career, Forbes magazine reported that he had been the party primarily responsible for the team's huge increase in merchandise sales, a total reported to top US$600&#160;million during Beckham's four years at the club.  
 Los Angeles Galaxy 
 
 
 
 I'm coming there not to be a superstar. I'm coming there to be part of the team, to work hard and to hopefully win things. With me, it's about football. I'm coming there to make a difference. I'm coming there to play football&#160;... I'm not saying me coming over to the States is going to make soccer the biggest sport in America. That would be difficult to achieve. Baseball, basketball, American football, they've been around. But I wouldn't be doing this if I didn't think I could make a difference.

 Beckham's involvement with Major League Soccer began while he was still a Real Madrid player when it was confirmed on 11 January 2007 that he would be leaving Madrid in six months to join MLS side Los Angeles Galaxy . The speculation about his new contract in Madrid was thus put to an end and the following day Beckham's official press conference was held in conjunction with the 2007 MLS SuperDraft .  
 The announcement made top news all across the globe. Though many worldwide media outlets reported the deal to be worth US$250&#160;million,  
 The high-profile acquisition paid immediate financial dividends for Galaxy long before Beckham joined the team. On the strength of the signing and the media frenzy it created, the club was able to pull off a new 5-year shirt sponsorship deal with Herbalife nutrition company worth US$20&#160;million. The gate revenue peaked as well with 11,000 new season tickets holders and sold-out luxury suites (each one of the 42 inside the team's home ground, the Home Depot Center ).  
 In the months following the announcement, the additional terms of Beckham's contract became public knowledge. One unique contract provision was giving him the option of buying an MLS expansion franchise in any market except New York City at the fixed price of $25 million whenever he stopped playing in the league  
 In April 2007, he and wife Victoria bought an $18.2&#160;million home on San Ysidro Drive in Beverly Hills .  
 Beckham's contract with LA Galaxy took effect on 11 July, and on 13 July, the famous Englishman was officially unveiled as a Galaxy player at the Home Depot Center to much fanfare and world media interest in front of more than 5,000 gathered fans and some 700 accredited media members.  
 In parallel, Beckham's handlers at 19 Entertainment succeeded in putting together an unprecedented US media rollout designed to expand his carefully crafted personal brand in America. He made the cover of Sports Illustrated , a few weeks earlier Adidas launched the extensive 13-part ad campaign "Fútbol meets Football" starring Beckham and NFL running back Reggie Bush , and W magazine published a racy photo spread featuring David and wife Victoria photographed by Steven Klein . Meanwhile, ESPN sports network was running "Hello, Goodbye" promotional campaign and it also agreed to air David Beckham: New Beginnings documentary produced by 19 Entertainment and directed by Gary Brooks before the friendly match versus Chelsea , which was expected to be Beckham's American debut. In addition to popularising soccer, Beckham's arrival was used as platform for entertainment industry endeavours. Since both Beckham's and his wife's often overlapping careers were handled by 19 Entertainment that's owned by Simon Fuller , who in turn has a business relationship with the Creative Artists Agency (CAA), one of Hollywood's most powerful talent agencies, it was important also for CAA that the Beckhams made as big a splash as possible upon their arrival in the United States. On 16 July, CAA had hosted a welcoming bash for David at its new eight-storey, $400&#160;million headquarters in Century City with CAA employees reportedly instructed beforehand to line the staircase and clap for Beckham upon his arrival.  
 
 
 
  
Beckham became the Los Angeles Galaxy captain immediately upon joining the team 
 
 
 On Saturday afternoon, 21 July, despite still nursing the injured left ankle that he picked up a month earlier during the final match of La Liga's season, Beckham made his Galaxy debut, coming on for Alan Gordon in the 78th minute of a 0–1 friendly loss to Chelsea as part of the World Series of Soccer .  
 The day after the made-for-TV debut was reserved for the welcoming party for the Beckhams at LA's Museum of Contemporary Art , formally billed as being hosted by Tom Cruise, Katie Holmes, Will Smith, and Jada Pinkett Smith though in actuality a CAA-organized event. Attended by many Hollywood A-listers , the lavish bash was big news in the US celebrity tabloid media, including daily entertainment TV magazines such as Entertainment Tonight and Access Hollywood .  
 Back on the soccer front, Beckham missed the next four Galaxy matches – three in the North American SuperLiga and an MLS game away at Toronto FC though he still made the trip with his teammates, sitting on the bench in street clothes. It was in Toronto on 5 August that the team got its first taste of what life would be like on the road with Beckham on the roster. Due to security concerns, it was the first time the team flew on a charter for a road match, rather than flying commercial (MLS normally forbids charter flights for away matches, claiming they provide competitive advantage, but in this case they made an exception due to the frenzy created around Beckham and resulting security issues). Also, instead of the usual MLS-mandated modest hotels, LA Galaxy stayed at the five-star Le Méridien King Edward in downtown Toronto (an expense paid for by the local Toronto promoter), while the glitz and glamour continued with the velvet rope, red carpet party at the Ultra Supper Club with Beckham as the centerpiece guest.

 Two weeks after his 12-minute appearance vs. Chelsea, still not fully healed Beckham finally made his league debut as a substitute on 9 August away versus DC United in front of the sellout crowd of 46,686 (nearly three times the average DC United home crowd) at the RFK Stadium , coming on for Quavas Kirk in the 71st minute.  Coming into the nationally televised match on ESPN, played under a heavy downpour with his team down a man and down a goal, even if only 70 percent fit, Beckham left a mark during the remaining twenty plus minutes. He hit a long free kick that Carlos Pavón failed to finish on for the equaliser, and then in the final minutes Beckham served a weighted through ball into Donovan's path that United's keeper Troy Perkins managed to break up in the last moment – the Galaxy lost 1–0. The next match on the road trip was at New England Revolution and Beckham decided to sit it out, fearing further aggravating his ankle injury on the Gillette Stadium 's artificial surface. 
 Beckham returned to the pitch the following week, again facing DC United, in the SuperLiga semi-final on 15 August. During this game he had many firsts with the Galaxy; his first start, first yellow card and first game as team captain.  He also scored his first goal for the team, from a free kick, and also made his first assist, for Landon Donovan in the second half. These goals gave the team a 2–0 victory, and a place in the North American SuperLiga final versus Pachuca on 29 August. 
 During the SuperLiga final against Pachuca, Beckham injured his right knee, with an MRI scan revealing that he had sprained his medial collateral ligament and would be out for six weeks. He returned to play in the final home match of the season. The Galaxy were eliminated from playoff contention on 21 October, in the final MLS match of the season, a 1–0 loss to the Chicago Fire . Beckham played as a substitute in the match, bringing his season totals to eight matches played (5 league); one goal scored (0 league); and three assists (2 league). 
 Beckham trained with Arsenal from 4 January 2008 for three weeks, until he returned to the Galaxy for pre-season training.  Overall, however, the Galaxy had a disappointing year, failing to qualify for the end-of-season play-offs. 
 Loan to Milan

 In 2008, Beckham's success in the England national team under Fabio Capello led to speculation that he might return to Europe to retain match fitness for the World Cup qualifying matches in 2009. On 30 October 2008, Milan announced that Beckham was to join them on loan from 7 January 2009.  
 Beckham was unveiled at Milan's training facility by the club's chief executive Adriano Galliani on 20 December 2008.  
 As the three-week Christmas break began in Serie A, entire Milan team flew to Dubai for winter training.  
 Playing on the squad led by the 26-year-old superstar Kaká in addition to several other world-class players at or near the peak of their careers – 28-year-old Ronaldinho , and 29-year-old Andrea Pirlo – as well as club veterans Paolo Maldini , Clarence Seedorf , Ambrosini, Giuseppe Favalli , Gianluca Zambrotta , Filippo Inzaghi , and Andriy Shevchenko , Beckham made his competitive debut for the rossoneri in Serie A as a starter away at Roma on 11 January 2009, playing 89&#160;minutes of the 2–2 draw in front of 53,444 at the Stadio Olimpico .  
 A noticeably older team, Ancelotti-coached Milan was proving a good fit for the 33-year-old Englishman. He scored his first goal in Serie A for Milan in a 4–1 victory over Bologna on 25 January, his third appearance for the club.  
 Still, negotiations continued during a month of speculation.  
 Return to Galaxy 
 After his return from Milan, many LA fans showed dislike and anger towards him as he missed the first half of the season and several held up signs saying "Go home fraud", and "Part time player".  
 Second loan spell at Milan 
 In November 2009, after the end of 2009 MLS season, it was confirmed that Beckham would return to Milan for a second loan period beginning in January 2010.  
 Beckham returned to Old Trafford for the second leg of the tie on 10 March 2010; he did not start the match, but was brought on for Ignazio Abate in the 64th minute to a positive reception from the Manchester United fans. The score was 3–0 for United at that point and the tie was all but decided. The match was the first time Beckham had played against Manchester United at Old Trafford and saw him create several scoring opportunities via crosses and corner kicks, but Manchester United dominated Milan and beat them 4–0, winning the tie 7–2.  
 In Milan's next game, against ChievoVerona , Beckham suffered a torn left Achilles tendon ,  
 Second return to Galaxy 
 On 11 September 2010, after recovering from his Achilles tendon injury, Beckham returned to the game as a substitute in the 70th minute in the Galaxy's 3–1 win over Columbus Crew .  
 During January and February 2011, ahead of the 2011 MLS season, Beckham trained with Tottenham Hotspur . Rumours in the media claimed that the club were in talks with the Galaxy to sign the player on loan, but, according to Spurs manager Harry Redknapp , the move was blocked by Galaxy, who wanted a full final season from their number 23.  As a result, he ended up only training with the club as he had done with Arsenal three years earlier. With Beckham playing in the centre of midfield, the Los Angeles Galaxy won the 2011 MLS cup.

 On 15 May, Beckham scored his first goal of the season for the Galaxy from a 30-yard free kick, in a 4–1 victory over Sporting Kansas City .  
 After having his best season with the Galaxy to date and finishing second in the league in assists, Beckham finished his fifth MLS season on a high. On 20 November 2011, he joined an elite group of players to have won three league titles in three different countries, when Los Angeles won their third MLS Cup against Houston Dynamo , winning 1–0 on a goal by captain Landon Donovan, with assists from Beckham and fellow designated player, Robbie Keane .  
 Following the 2011 season, in which the Galaxy won their second consecutive Supporters' Shield , having the second most points in MLS history, Beckham's five-year contract with the Galaxy expired on 31 December 2011. Despite being 36, he stated that he did not intend to retire. Beckham was heavily linked with Paris Saint-Germain , but on 18 January 2012, Galaxy announced Beckham had signed a new two-year contract to remain in Los Angeles.  
 Beckham helped the Galaxy to a fourth place finish in the MLS Western Conference 2012 regular season with Beckham scoring seven goals and adding nine assists. The Galaxy defeated Vancouver, San Jose, Seattle and then 3–1 over Houston to retain the MLS Cup .  
 Paris Saint-Germain and retirement 
 On 29 January 2013, Beckham began training with Arsenal , but any deal for the player was quickly quashed by manager Arsène Wenger who denied any interest in signing Beckham, going on to mention that the arrangement was solely for the purpose of fitness.  
 On 16 May 2013, Beckham announced that he would retire from professional football at the end of that year's French football season.  
 Following his decision to retire at the end of the 2012–13 season, Beckham was given specially designed boots in the colours of the Union Jack to wear in his final game. These boots had the names of his wife, Victoria, and children stitched on to them. On 18 May 2013, Beckham was made captain in his final home game against Brest. In this game Beckham assisted a goal by Matuidi from a corner. Beckham was subbed after 80 minutes, receiving hugs from his fellow players and manager, as well as a standing ovation from fans. PSG went on to win the game 3–1. 
 International career 
 
 
 
  
Beckham as England captain 
 
 
 Beckham made his first appearance for the England national football team on 1 September 1996, in a World Cup qualifying match against Moldova .  
 Beckham had played in all of England's qualifying matches for the 1998 World Cup and was part of the England squad at the World Cup finals in France,  and he did not start in either of England's first two matches. He was picked for their third match against Colombia and scored from a long-range free kick in a 2–0 victory, which was his first goal for England. 
 In the second round (last 16) of that competition, he received a red card in England's match against Argentina .  
 The abuse that Beckham was receiving from English supporters peaked during England's 3–2 defeat by Portugal in Euro 2000 , a match where Beckham set up two goals, when a group of England supporters taunted him throughout the match.  
 On 15 November 2000, following Kevin Keegan 's resignation as England manager in October, Beckham was promoted to team captain by the caretaker manager Peter Taylor , and then kept the role under new manager Sven-Göran Eriksson . He helped England to qualify for the 2002 World Cup Finals, with their performances including an impressive 5–1 victory over Germany in Munich. The final step in Beckham's conversion from villain to hero happened in England's 2–2 draw against Greece on 6 October 2001. England needed to win or draw the match to qualify outright for the World Cup, but were losing 2–1 with little time remaining. When Teddy Sheringham was fouled eight yards (7&#160;metres) outside the Greek penalty area, England were awarded a free-kick and Beckham ensured England's qualification with a curling strike of the kind that had become his trademark. Shortly afterwards, he was voted the BBC Sports Personality of the Year for 2001. He once again finished runner-up, to Luís Figo of Portugal, for the FIFA World Player of the Year award. 
 Beckham was partially fit by the time of the 2002 World Cup and played in the first match against Sweden . Beckham scored the winning goal of the match against Argentina with a penalty, causing Argentina to fail to qualify for the knockout stage. England were knocked out of the tournament in the quarter-finals by eventual winners Brazil . The following month, at the opening ceremony of the 2002 Commonwealth Games in Manchester, Beckham escorted Kirsty Howard as she presented the Jubilee Baton to the Queen . 
 Beckham played in all of England's matches at Euro 2004 , but the tournament was a disappointment for him. He had a penalty saved in England's 2–1 defeat to France and missed another in a penalty shootout in the quarter-final match against Portugal . England lost the shootout thus going out of the competition. 
 Beckham became a UNICEF Goodwill Ambassador in January 2005 and was involved in promoting London's successful bid for the 2012 Olympic Games .  In October 2005, Beckham's sending off against Austria made him the first England captain to be sent off and the first player to be sent off twice while playing for England. He captained England for the 50th time in a friendly international against Argentina the following month. 
 In England's opening game at the 2006 World Cup , against Paraguay on 10 June 2006, Beckham's free kick led to an own-goal by Carlos Gamarra as England won 1–0. In England's next match, played against Trinidad and Tobago on 15 June 2006, Beckham's cross in the 83rd minute led to a Peter Crouch goal, which put England into the lead 1–0. Beckham gave another assist to Steven Gerrard . In the end they won 2–0. He was named Man of the Match by tournament sponsor Budweiser for this game. 
 During England's second round match against Ecuador , Beckham scored from a free kick in the 59th minute, becoming the first English player to score in three separate World Cups,  and giving England a 1–0 victory and a place in the quarter-finals. He was sick before the game and vomited several times as a result of dehydration and illness after he scored the winning goal. 
 In the quarter-final against Portugal, Beckham was substituted following an injury shortly after half time and the England team went on to lose the match on penalties (3–1), the score having been 0–0 after extra time. After his substitution, Beckham was visibly shaken and emotional for not being able to play, being in tears at one point. 
 A day after England were knocked out of the World Cup, an emotional Beckham made a statement in a news conference saying that he had stepped down as England captain,  
 Having stepped down as captain after the World Cup, Beckham was dropped completely from the England national team selected by new coach Steve McClaren on 11 August 2006. McClaren claimed that he was "looking to go in a different direction" with the team, and that Beckham "wasn't included within that." McClaren said Beckham could be recalled in future. Shaun Wright-Phillips , Kieran Richardson , and the World Cup alternative to Beckham, Aaron Lennon , were all included, although McClaren eventually opted to employ Steven Gerrard in that role. 
 
 
 
  
Beckham takes the free kick against Brazil from which John Terry scored 
 
 
 On 26 May 2007, McClaren announced that Beckham would be recalled to the England squad for the first time since stepping down as their captain. Beckham started against Brazil in England's first match at the new Wembley Stadium and put in a positive performance. In the second half, he set up England's goal converted by captain John Terry . It looked as though England would claim victory over Brazil, but newcomer Diego equalised in the dying seconds. In England's next match, a Euro 2008 qualifier against Estonia , Beckham sent two trademark assists for Michael Owen and Peter Crouch , helping England to prevail 3–0. 
 Beckham had assisted in three of England's four total goals in those two games,  and he stated his desire to continue to play for England after his move to Major League Soccer . 
 On 22 August 2007, Beckham played in a friendly for England against Germany , becoming the first to play for England while with a non-European club team.  
 On 20 March 2008, Beckham was recalled to the England squad by Capello for the friendly against France in Paris on 26 March. Beckham became only the fifth Englishman to win 100 caps. Capello had hinted on 25 March 2008 that Beckham had a long term future in his side ahead of crucial qualifiers for the 2010 World Cup .  
 During the 2010 World Cup Qualifier against Belarus in which England won 3–1 in Minsk , Beckham came off the bench in the 87th minute to earn his 107th cap making him England's third-most- capped player in history, overtaking Bobby Charlton in the process. On 11 February 2009, Beckham drew level with Bobby Moore 's record of 108 caps for an English outfield player, coming on as a substitute for Stewart Downing in a friendly match against Spain .  
 In all, Beckham had made 16 appearances out of a possible 20 for England under Capello until his ruptured Achilles tendon of March 2010 ruled him out of selection for the 2010 FIFA World Cup in South Africa.  
 After a poor performance from England at the World Cup Capello remained as manager, but was under pressure to revamp the England squad for the imminent UEFA Euro 2012 qualification campaign . He unveiled a new team at the next England match, a home friendly game against Hungary on 11 August 2010, with Beckham still unavailable for selection but aiming for a return to playing in MLS by the following month.  
 Beckham was named in the provisional squad to represent the Great Britain Olympic football team at the 2012 Olympics.

 Coaching career 
 England 2010 
 Due to an injury suffered to his torn left Achilles tendon , Beckham was forced to miss the 2010 FIFA World Cup as a player. On 14 May 2010 it was announced that Beckham would work as a mediator between management and the players, and as an English member of the coaching staff for the England national football team at the tournament.  As an agreement between Beckham, his representatives, his club, Los Angeles Galaxy and Fabio Capello, the former England captain was on the plane to South Africa on 2 June 2010. 
 Discipline 
 Training and Praise from Managers 
 Beckham is a "product of Sir Alex Ferguson 's school of hard graft" at Manchester United. Ferguson noted that Beckham "practised with a discipline to achieve an accuracy that other players wouldn't care about."  
 Beckham maintained his training routine at Real Madrid and even when his relationship with management was strained in early 2007, Real Madrid president Ramón Calderón and manager Fabio Capello praised Beckham for maintaining his professionalism and commitment to the club.  
 In May 2013, when Beckham was asked about how he wanted to be remembered in his retirement, he said "I just want people to see me as a hardworking footballer, someone that's passionate about the game, someone that – every time I stepped on the pitch – I've given everything that I have, because that's how I feel. That's how I look back on it and hope people will see me."  
 Bookings 
 Beckham was the first England player ever to collect two red cards and the first England captain to be sent off.  Beckham's most notorious red card was during the 1998 FIFA World Cup after Argentina's Diego Simeone had fouled him: Beckham, lying face down on the pitch, kicked out at the Argentine midfielder, who fell dramatically. 
 He amassed 41 yellow cards and four red cards in his time at Real Madrid, all four reds came in La Liga.

 Major League Soccer team in Miami 
 On 5 February 2014, Major League Soccer announced that Beckham had exercised his option to buy a MLS expansion team for $25 million, which he had received as part of the contract he signed with the Los Angeles Galaxy in 2007.  
 David Beckham Academy 
 
 
 
  
David Beckham Academy 
 
 
 In 2005, Beckham founded the David Beckham Academy football school, operating from two sites: in London and in Los Angeles, California. It was announced in late 2009 that both would close.  
 Personal life 
 
 
 
  
David and Victoria Beckham at the 2007 British Grand Prix at Silverstone 
 
 
 In 1997, Beckham started dating Victoria Adams , after she attended a Manchester United match. She was famously known as "Posh Spice" of the pop music group Spice Girls , one of the world's top pop groups at the time, and his team was also enjoying a great run of success. Therefore, their relationship instantly attracted a great deal of media attention. The couple were dubbed " Posh and Becks " by the media. He proposed to her on 24 January 1998 in a restaurant in Cheshunt , England. 
 On 4 July 1999, David and Victoria married at Luttrellstown Castle in Ireland. The wedding attracted tremendous media coverage. Beckham's teammate Gary Neville was the best man, and the couple's infant son, Brooklyn, was the ring bearer. The media were kept away from the ceremony, as the Beckhams had an exclusive deal with OK! Magazine , but newspapers were still able to obtain photographs showing them sitting on golden thrones.  
 In 1999, David and Victoria Beckham purchased their most famous home in Hertfordshire , unofficially dubbed Beckingham Palace , estimated to be worth £7.5&#160;million. David and Victoria Beckham have four children: sons Brooklyn Joseph (born 1999 in London), Romeo James (born 2002 in London), and Cruz David (born 2005 in Madrid ; the word "cruz" is Spanish for "cross"); and daughter Harper Seven (born 2011, in Los Angeles).  
 In April 2007, the family purchased their current main residence, an Italian villa in Beverly Hills , to coincide with Beckham's transfer to the Galaxy that July. The mansion, priced at $22&#160;million, is near the homes of Tom Cruise and Katie Holmes , and talk-show host Jay Leno , in an exclusive gated community in the hills overlooking the city. The family also owned a home in Dubai .  
 Beckham suffers from obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD), which he says makes him "have everything in a straight line or everything has to be in pairs." Victoria Beckham claims, "If you open our fridge, it's all co-ordinated down either side. We've got three fridges – food in one, salad in another and drinks in the third. In the drinks one, everything is symmetrical. If there's three cans, he'll throw one away because it has to be an even number."  
 Affair claims 
 In April 2004, the British tabloid News of the World carried claims by Beckham's former personal assistant Rebecca Loos that he and Loos had an extramarital affair.  
 Legal issues 
 In December 2008, Beckham and his bodyguard were sued by paparazzi photographer Emicles da Mata, who claimed that he was assaulted by them when attempting to take a picture of Beckham in Beverly Hills . Da Mata is seeking unspecified damages for assault, battery, and intentional infliction of emotional distress.  
 In September 2010, Beckham announced that he was pressing charges against prostitute Irma Nici and several others over claims in the magazine In Touch that he had had sex with her.  Beckham's court application was dismissed. 
 Outside of football 
 
 
 
  
Beckham in December 2009 
 
 
 Beckham's fame extends beyond the pitch ; in much of the world his name is "as instantly recognisable as that of multinational companies like Coca-Cola and IBM ."  
 Beckham became known as a fashion icon, and together with Victoria, the couple became lucrative spokespeople sought after by clothing designers, health and fitness specialists, fashion magazines, perfume and cosmetics manufacturers, hair stylists, exercise promoters, and spa and recreation companies. One recent example is a new line of aftershave and fragrances called David Beckham Instinct.  
 Upon their arrival in Los Angeles on 12 July 2007, the night before Beckham's formal introduction, Los Angeles International Airport was filled with paparazzi and news reporters.  
 Beckham's many endorsement deals make him one of the most recognisable athletes throughout the world. On 31 December 2008, it was announced that Pepsi Co. was ending its endorsement deal with the player after a 10-year collaboration.  
 Beckham visited Afghanistan in May 2010 for a morale-boosting visit to British troops fighting the Taliban insurgency .  In September, Beckham released Homme by David Beckham . 
 Chief executive at LA Galaxy, Tim Leiweke , said in July 2012 that Beckham's fame was so strong that even the then-next Chinese president Xi Jinping 's security guards lost focus when the footballer walked into the room at a meeting in February 2012.  
 In March 2013, Beckham was named as the first global ambassador for Chinese football, which has recently been hit by a match-fixing scandal and an exodus of international stalwarts from the country's premier league.  
 From 14 July 2013 Beckham started appearing in adverts for BSkyB advertising their Sky Sports coverage via the Sky Go app.  He had previously appeared in Samsung 's adverts for the Galaxy S3 smartphone in 2012. 
 Charitable work 
 Beckham has supported UNICEF since his days at Manchester United and in January 2005, the English national team captain became a Goodwill Ambassador with a special focus on UNICEF's Sports for Development program. More recently, Beckham has pledged his support for the current Unite for Children, Unite Against AIDS campaign. He is also a patron of the Elton John AIDS Foundation .  
 On 17 January 2007, Rebecca Johnstone, a 19-year-old cancer patient from Hamilton, Ontario , Canada, received a surprise phone call from Beckham. After the conversation, he sent her a Real Madrid jersey with his signature on it. Rebecca died on 29 January 2007.  
 Beckham is a founding member of the Malaria No More UK Leadership Council and helped launch the charity in 2009 with Andy Murray at Wembley Stadium. Video footage from the day can be seen on YouTube and the charity's website malarianomore.org.uk . Beckham also appeared in a 2007 public service announcement for Malaria No More US, advertising the need for inexpensive bed nets. The TV spot aired in the US on Fox Networks , including Fox Soccer Channel , and can also be seen on YouTube.  
 Since joining Major League Soccer , Beckham has been a very public advocate in the US for related charities such as "MLS W.O.R.K.S." On 17 August 2007, he conducted a youth clinic in Harlem , along with other current and former MLS players. This was in advance of his first New York City area match the following day against the New York Red Bulls . That team's Jozy Altidore and Juan Pablo Ángel were also with Beckham, teaching skills to disadvantaged youth to benefit FC Harlem Lions .  
 Appearances in films 
 Bend It Like Beckham 
 Beckham never personally appeared in the 2002 film Bend It Like Beckham , except in archive footage. He and his wife wanted to make cameo appearances, but scheduling proved difficult, so the director used lookalike Andy Harmer instead.  
 The Goal! Trilogy 
 Beckham makes a cameo appearance with Zinedine Zidane and Raúl , in the 2005 film Goal!: The Dream Begins . Lookalike Andy Harmer, who played him in Bend It Like Beckham , also appears here in one party scene as Beckham.  
 Despite moving to Los Angeles, California, Beckham has expressed no personal interest in pursuit of acting roles, saying he is too "stiff".  
 Records 
 Beckham has captained England 59 times,  the fourth highest after Bobby Moore (90), Billy Wright (90) and Bryan Robson (65). 
 With his free kick goal against Ecuador in the second round of the 2006 FIFA World Cup , Beckham gained membership into two of football's exclusive clubs: he became the only English player – and the 21st player regardless of nationality – to score in three world cups; Real Madrid teammate Raúl also achieved this feat a few days earlier.  It also made him only the fifth player in World Cup history to score twice from a direct free kick; the other four were Pelé , Roberto Rivelino , Teófilo Cubillas , and Bernard Genghini (Beckham had previously scored this way against Colombia in the first round of the 1998 FIFA World Cup ). All three goals were against South American teams (Colombia, Argentina , and Ecuador) and from set pieces (the two aforementioned free kicks and a penalty against Argentina). 
 Tattoos 
 Beckham has at least 20 tattoos adorning his body, including a black-and-white image of Christ drawn on his right side, based on a painting called "The Man of Sorrows" by Catholic artist Matthew R. Brooks done after the death of his grandfather in 2009.  In his autobiography "David Beckham: My Side", Becks reveals some of his thoughts on tattoos: "The idea came to me much later, a little while after Brooklyn was born. I was talking to Mel B and her then-husband, Jimmy Gulzar, and the subject of tattoos came up. I ended up going to this Dutch guy who'd done all of Jimmy's. I'd finally realised what I wanted a tattoo to represent. Mine are all about the people in my life, my wife and sons, who I want with me always. When you see me, you see the tattoos. You see an expression of how I feel about Victoria and the boys. They're part of me.
