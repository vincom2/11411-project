 Star Trek is a 2009 American science fiction action film directed by J. J. Abrams , written by Roberto Orci and Alex Kurtzman and distributed by Paramount Pictures . It is the eleventh film of the Star Trek film franchise and is also a reboot that features the main characters of the original Star Trek television series , portrayed by a new cast. The film follows James T. Kirk ( Chris Pine ) and Spock ( Zachary Quinto ) aboard the USS Enterprise as they combat Nero ( Eric Bana ), a Romulan from their future who threatens the United Federation of Planets . The story takes place in an alternate reality  due to time travel by both Nero and the original Spock ( Leonard Nimoy ). The alternate timeline was created in an effort to free the film and the franchise from established continuity constraints while simultaneously preserving original story elements. 
 Development for Star Trek originated in 1968, when creator Gene Roddenberry announced plans to produce a prequel modeled after the television series. The concept resurfaced temporarily in the late 1980s, when it was postulated by Harve Bennett as a possible plotline for the movie that would become Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country , but was rejected in lieu of other projects by Roddenberry. Following the critical and commercial failure of Star Trek: Nemesis and the cancellation of the television series Star Trek: Enterprise , franchise executive producer Rick Berman and screenwriter Erik Jendresen wrote an un-produced film, titled Star Trek: The Beginning , which would take place after Enterprise . After the split between Viacom and CBS Corporation , former Paramount president Gail Berman convinced CBS to produce a feature film. Orci and Kurtzman, both fans of the Star Trek series, were approached to write the film and Abrams was approached to direct it. Kurtzman and Orci used inspiration from novels and graduate school dissertations as well as the series itself. 
 Principal photography commenced on November 7, 2007 and ended on March 27, 2008. The film was shot in various locations around California and Utah. Abrams wanted to avoid using bluescreen and greenscreen, opting to use sets and locations instead. Heavy secrecy surrounded the film's production and was under the fake working title Corporate Headquarters . Industrial Light &amp; Magic used digital ships for the film, as opposed to the previous films in the franchise. Production for the film concluded by the end of 2008. 
 Star Trek was heavily promoted the months preceding its release; pre-release screenings for the film premiered in select cities around the world including Austin, Texas , Sydney , Australia, and Calgary, Alberta . It was released in the United States and Canada on May 8, 2009, to very positive reviews. Critics praised the character development as well as the storyline in the film. Star Trek became a box office success, grossing over $385.7 million worldwide. It was nominated for several awards, including four Academy Awards at the 82nd Academy Awards , ultimately winning in the category for Best Makeup , making it the first Star Trek film to win an Academy Award. The DVD and Blu-ray for the film were released on November 17, 2009. Following the success of the film, its cast members signed on for two sequels, making Star Trek the first of a planned trilogy. A sequel, Star Trek Into Darkness , was released on May 16, 2013 with Abrams returning as director and Orci and Kurtzman returning as screenwriters (with the addition of Star Trek producer Damon Lindelof as screenwriter).

 Plot  
 In 2233, the Federation starship USS Kelvin is investigating a "lightning storm" in space. A Romulan ship, the Narada , emerges from the storm and attacks the Kelvin . Narada ' s first officer , Ayel, demands that the Kelvin' s Captain Robau come aboard to negotiate a truce. Once aboard, Robau is questioned about the current stardate and an "Ambassador Spock ", whom he professes not to know. Narada ' s commander, Nero , kills him, and continues his attack on the Kelvin . George Kirk, the Kelvin ' s first officer, orders the ship's personnel, including his pregnant wife Winona, to evacuate the ship while he pilots the Kelvin on a collision course with the Narada , as the auto-pilot function has been damaged. At the cost of his life, Kirk ensures Winona's survival as she gives birth to James T. Kirk . 
 In 2250, on the planet Vulcan , a young Spock is accepted to join the Vulcan Science Academy. Realizing that the Academy views his human mother Amanda Grayson as a "disadvantage," he decides to join Starfleet instead. On Earth , Kirk becomes a reckless but intelligent young adult. In 2255, after a bar fight with Starfleet cadets accompanying Nyota Uhura , Kirk meets Captain Christopher Pike who encourages him to enlist in Starfleet Academy where Kirk meets and befriends the cynical doctor Leonard McCoy . 
 Three years later, Commander Spock accuses Kirk of cheating during his Kobayashi Maru simulation. Kirk argues that cheating was acceptable in this context because the simulation had been designed to be unbeatable. The disciplinary hearing is interrupted by a distress signal from Vulcan. With the primary fleet out of range, the cadets are mobilized. McCoy and Kirk board Pike's ship, the Enterprise . Realizing that the "lightning storm" being observed on Vulcan is similar to the one that occurred at the time of his birth, Kirk breaks protocol to convince Pike that the distress signal is a trap. 
 Enterprise arrives at Vulcan to find the fleet destroyed and the Narada drilling into Vulcan's core . The Narada attacks the Enterprise and Pike surrenders, delegating command of the ship to Spock and promoting Kirk to first officer. Kirk, Hikaru Sulu , and Chief Engineer Olson perform a space jump  onto the drilling platform. Olson is killed but Kirk and Sulu disable it. However, Nero launches "red matter" into the core, creating an artificial black hole that destroys the planet. Spock rescues the Vulcan high council and his father Sarek , though his mother dies. 
 As the Narada heads toward Earth, Nero tortures Pike to gain access to Earth's defenses, and Kirk is stranded on Delta Vega after attempting mutiny . Kirk encounters an older Spock, who explains that he and Nero are from 129 years into the future when Romulus was threatened by a supernova . Spock's attempt to use "red matter" to create an artificial black hole and consume the supernova was too late, and Nero's family perished along with Romulus. Narada and Spock's vessel were caught in the black hole, sending them back in time. Nero stranded Spock on Delta Vega to watch Vulcan's destruction as revenge for failing to save Romulus. 
 Reaching a Starfleet outpost, Kirk and Spock Prime meet Montgomery Scott . With the elder Spock's help, Kirk and Scott beam onto the Enterprise . Following the elder Spock's advice, Kirk provokes Spock into attacking him, leading Spock to relinquish command due to being emotionally compromised. After talking with Sarek, Spock decides to help Kirk. While Enterprise hides itself under the gas clouds of Titan , Kirk and Spock beam aboard the Narada ; Kirk rescues Pike while Spock uses the elder Spock's ship to destroy the drill. Spock leads the Narada away from Earth and sets his ship to collide with Nero's ship. Enterprise arrives and beams Kirk, Pike, and Spock aboard. The older Spock's ship and the Narada collide, igniting the "red matter" and consuming the Narada in a black hole. 
 On Earth, Kirk is promoted to the rank of Captain and commanding officer of the Enterprise , while Pike is promoted to Rear Admiral. Spock encounters his older self. Having selected a planet for the surviving Vulcans to colonize, the older Spock persuades his younger self to continue serving in Starfleet, encouraging him to do what feels right instead of logical. Spock remains in Starfleet and becomes first officer under Kirk's command. Enterprise goes to warp as the elder Spock narrates the " where no-one has gone before " monologue. 
 Cast  
 
 
 
  
 
 
  
 
 
  
 
 From top to bottom: Chris Pine, Zachary Quinto, and Zoe Saldana. 
 
 
 
 Chris Pine as James T. Kirk 
 Pine described his first audition as "awful," because he could not take himself seriously as a leader.  
 
 Jimmy Bennett portrays a younger Kirk. 
 
 
 
 
 Zachary Quinto as Spock 
 The younger alternate timeline Spock. Quinto expressed interest in the role because of the duality of Spock's half-human, half Vulcan heritage,  
 
 Jacob Kogan portrays a younger Spock. 
 
 
 
 
 Leonard Nimoy as Spock Prime 
 Nimoy reprises the role of the older Spock from the original Star Trek timeline, credited as "Spock Prime". He is a longtime friend of Abrams' parents,  
 
 
 Eric Bana as Nero 
 The film's time-traveling Romulan villain. Bana shot his scenes toward the end of filming. He wasn't "a huge Trekkie when  
 
 
 Karl Urban as Dr. Leonard "Bones" McCoy 
 Like Pine, Urban said of taking on the role that "it is a case of not doing some sort of facsimile or carbon copy, but really taking the very essence of what DeForest Kelley has done and honoring that and bringing something new to the table". Urban has been a fan of the show since he was seven years old and actively pursued the role after rediscovering the series on DVD with his son.  
 
 
 Zoe Saldana as Nyota Uhura 
 Abrams asked her to play the role because he had seen her previous work and liked it. Saldana had never seen the original series, though she had played a Trekkie in The Terminal (2004), but agreed to play the role after Abrams complimented her. "For an actor, that's all you need, that's all you want. To get the acknowledgment and respect from your peers," she said. She met with Nichelle Nichols , who explained to her how she had created Uhura's background and had named the character.  The film officially establishes the character's first name, which had never been previously uttered on TV or in film. And also (in an officially discreet manner) that Uhura and Spock are, in fact, lovers and had been romantically linked for some time during the film. 
 
 
 Simon Pegg as Montgomery "Scotty" Scott 
 Abrams contacted Pegg by e-mail, offering him the part.  
 
 
 John Cho as Hikaru Sulu 
 Abrams had at first been concerned about casting a Korean-American as a Japanese character, but George Takei reassured him that Sulu had been meant to represent all of Asia on the Enterprise , so Abrams went ahead with Cho.  
 
 
 Anton Yelchin as Pavel Chekov 
 As with the rest of the cast, Yelchin was allowed to choose what elements there were from their predecessor's performances. Yelchin decided to carry on Walter Koenig 's speech patterns of replacing "v"s with "w"s , although he and Abrams felt this was a trait more common of Polish accents than Russian ones.  
 
 Bruce Greenwood plays Christopher Pike , the captain of the Enterprise .  
 Additional minor roles include Rachel Nichols as Gaila, an Orion Starfleet cadet; Deep Roy as Scotty's assistant Keenser; and Paul McGillion as a Starfleet barracks leader.   Victor Garber plays a Klingon interrogator who tortures Nero during his time on Rura Penthe. 
 Tyler Perry appears as the head of Starfleet Academy , Admiral Richard Barnett. James Cawley , producer and star of the webseries Star Trek: New Voyages , appears as a Starfleet officer, while Pavel Lychnikoff and Lucia Rijker play Romulans, Lychnikoff a Commander and Rijker a Communications Officer. W. Morgan Sheppard , who played a Klingon in Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country , as well as Data's allegorical grandfather in the TNG episode "The Schizoid Man" , appears in this film as the head of the Vulcan Science Council. Wil Wheaton , known for portraying Wesley Crusher on Star Trek: The Next Generation , was brought in, through urging by Greg Grunberg, to voice several of the other Romulans in the film.  
 Orci and Kurtzman wrote a scene for Shatner , where old Spock gives his younger self a recorded message by Kirk from the previous timeline. "It was basically a Happy Birthday wish knowing that Spock was going to go off to Romulus, and Kirk would probably be dead by the time," and it would have transitioned into Shatner reciting "Where no man has gone before".  
 Production  
 Development  
 As early as the 1968 World Science Fiction Convention , Star Trek creator Roddenberry had said he was going to make a film prequel to the television series .  
 In 2005, Viacom , which owned Paramount Pictures, split from CBS Corporation , which retained Paramount's television properties, including ownership of the Star Trek brand. Gail Berman , then president of Paramount, convinced CBS' chief executive, Leslie Moonves , to allow them eighteen months to develop a new Star Trek film before CBS would re-earn the rights to develop a new television series (in return, CBS would keep merchandising rights). Berman approached Mission: Impossible III writers Orci and Kurtzman for ideas on the new film, and after the film had completed shooting she asked their director, Abrams, to produce it.  
 In an interview, Abrams said that he had never seen Star Trek: Nemesis because he felt the franchise had "disconnected" from the original series.  
 On February 23, 2007, Abrams accepted Paramount's offer to direct the film, after having initially been attached to it solely as a producer.  
 Writing  
 
 
 
 "We're from different worlds, Alex  was born here, and I was born in Mexico City and lived there until I was nine. Kirk and Spock are opposites from two worlds. That's us in a nutshell. We're drawn to each by what each of us lacks. The story of this film is about two guys who are such opposites that they might end up strangling each other but instead they bond and thrive together. That's us. We can go warp speed together." 
 
 
 Roberto Orci on the film's emotional context.  
 
 Orci said getting Nimoy in the film was very important. "Having him sitting around a camp fire sharing his memories was never gonna cut it" though, and time travel was going to be included in the film from the beginning.  
 Orci noted while the time travel story allowed them to alter some backstory elements such as Kirk's first encounter with the Romulans, they could not use it as a crutch to change everything and they tried to approach the film as a prequel as much as possible. Kirk's service on the Farragut , a major backstory point to the original episode " Obsession ", was left out because it was deemed irrelevant to the story of Kirk meeting Spock, although Orci felt nothing in his script precluded it from the new film's backstory.  
 The filmmakers sought inspiration from novels such as Prime Directive , Spock's World , and Best Destiny to fill in gaps unexplained by canon; Best Destiny particularly explores Kirk's childhood and names his parents.  
 Orci and Kurtzman said they wanted the general audience to like the film as much as the fans, by stripping away " Treknobabble ", making it action-packed and giving it the simple title of Star Trek to indicate to newcomers they would not need to watch any of the other films.  
 Orci and Kurtzman read graduate school dissertations on the series for inspiration;  
 The USS Kelvin , the ship Kirk's father serves on, is named after J. J. Abrams' grandfather, as well as the physicist and engineer Lord Kelvin (William Thomson) . The Kelvin ' s captain, Richard Robau ( Faran Tahir ), is named after Orci's Cuban uncle: Orci theorized the fictional character was born in Cuba and grew up in the Middle East.  
 Design  
 The film's production designer was Scott Chambliss, a longtime collaborator with Abrams. Chambliss worked with a large group of concept illustrators, including James Clyne, Ryan Church , creature designer Neville Page , and Star Trek veteran John Eaves .  
 
 
 
  
Panorama of the Enterprise ' s redesigned bridge 
 
 
 Production designer Scott Chambliss maintained the layout of the original bridge, but aesthetically altered it with brighter colors to reflect the optimism of Star Trek . The viewscreen was made into a window that could have images projected on it to make the space environment palpable. Abrams compared the redesign to the sleek modernist work of Pierre Cardin and the sets from 2001: A Space Odyssey , which were from the 1960s.  
 Abrams selected Michael Kaplan to design the costumes because he had not seen any of the films, meaning he would approach the costumes with a new angle. For the Starfleet uniforms , Kaplan followed the show's original color-coding, with dark gray (almost black) undershirts and pants and colored overshirts showing each crew member's position. Command officers wear gold shirts, science and medical officers wear blue, and operations (technicians, engineers, and security personnel) wear red. Kaplan wanted the shirts to be more sophisticated than the originals and selected to have the Starfleet symbol patterned on them.  
 Lindelof compared the film's Romulan faction to pirates with their bald, tattooed heads and disorganized costuming. Their ship, the Narada , is purely practical with visible mechanics as it is a "working ship", unlike the Enterprise crew who give a respectable presentation on behalf of the Federation .  
 Barney Burman supervised the makeup for the other aliens: his team had to rush the creation of many of the aliens, because originally the majority of them were to feature in one scene towards the end of filming. Abrams deemed the scene too similar to the cantina sequence in Star Wars and decided to dot the designs around the film.  
 Filming  
 Principal photography for the film began on November 7, 2007 and culminated on March 27, 2008;

 Following the initiation of the 2007–2008 Writers Guild of America strike on November 5, 2007, Abrams, himself a WGA member, told Variety that while he would not render writing services for the film and intended to walk the picket line, he did not expect the strike to impact his directing of the production.  
 The production team maintained heavily enforced security around the film. Karl Urban revealed, " 
 Abrams chose to shoot the film in the anamorphic format on 35 mm film after discussions about whether the film should be shot in high-definition digital video. Cinematographer Dan Mindel and Abrams agreed the choice gave the film a big-screen feel and the realistic, organic look they wanted for the film setting.  
 When the shoot ended, Abrams gave the cast small boxes containing little telescopes, which allowed them to read the name of each constellation it was pointed at. "I think he just wanted each of us to look at the stars a little differently," said John Cho .  
 Effects  
 Industrial Light &amp; Magic and Digital Domain were among several companies that created over 1,000 special effect shots.  
 Star Trek was the first film ILM worked on using entirely digital ships.  
 Carolyn Porco of NASA was consulted on the planetary science and imagery.  
 Lola Visual Effects worked on 48 shots, including some animation to Bana and Nimoy. Bana required extensive damage to his teeth, which was significant enough to completely replace his mouth in some shots. Nimoy's mouth was reanimated in his first scene with Kirk following a rerecording session. The filmmakers had filmed Nimoy when he rerecorded his lines so they could rotoscope his mouth into the film, even recreating the lighting conditions, but they realized they had to digitally recreate his lips because of the bouncing light created by the camp fire.  
 Music  
 Main article: Star Trek (soundtrack) 
 Michael Giacchino , Abrams' most frequent collaborator, composed the music for Star Trek . He kept the original theme by Alexander Courage for the end credits, which Abrams said symbolized the momentum of the crew coming together.  
 Sound effects  
 The sound effects were designed by Star Wars veteran Ben Burtt . Whereas the phaser blast noises from the television series were derived from The War of the Worlds (1953), Burtt made his phaser sounds more like his blasters from Star Wars , because Abrams' depiction of phasers were closer to the blasters' bullet-like fire, rather than the steady beams of energy in previous Star Trek films. Burtt reproduced the classic photon torpedo and warp drive sounds: he tapped a long spring against a contact microphone , and combined that with cannon fire. Burtt used a 1960s oscillator to create a musical and emotional hum to the warping and transporting sounds.  
 Release

 In February 2008, Paramount announced they would move Star Trek from its December 25, 2008 release date to May 8, 2009, as the studio felt more people would see the film during summer than winter. The film was practically finished by the end of 2008.  
 A surprise public screening was held on April 6, 2009, at the Alamo Drafthouse theater in Austin, Texas , hosted by writers Robert Orci, Alex Kurtzman, and producer Damon Lindelof. The showing was publicized as a screening of Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan , followed by a ten-minute preview of the new Star Trek film. A few minutes into Khan , the film appeared to melt and Nimoy appeared on stage with Orci, Kurtzman and Lindelof, asking the audience, "wouldn't you rather see the new movie?"  
 Marketing

 The first teaser trailer debuted in theaters with Cloverfield on January 18, 2008, which showed the Enterprise under construction. Abrams himself directed the first part of the trailer, where a welder removes his goggles. Professional welders were hired for the teaser.  
 Paramount faced two obstacles in promoting the film: the unfamiliarity of the "MySpace generation" with the franchise and the relatively weak international performance of the previous films. Six months before the film's release, Abrams toured Europe and North America with 25 minutes of footage. Abrams noted the large-scale campaign started unusually early, but this was because the release delay allowed him to show more completed scenes than normal. The director preferred promoting his projects quietly, but concurred Paramount needed to remove Star Trek ' s stigma.  
 Promotional partners on the film include Nokia , Verizon Wireless , Esurance , Kellogg's , Burger King and Intel Corporation , as well as various companies specializing in home decorating, apparel, jewelry, gift items and "Tiberius", "Pon Farr" and "Red Shirt" fragrances.  
 Home release  
 The film was released on DVD and Blu-ray on November 17, 2009 in North America,  
 Reaction  
 Box office  
 Official screenings in the United States started at 7&#160;pm on May 7, 2009,  
 Reception  
 Star Trek was acclaimed by film critics. The film has a 95% approval rating on the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes , based on 298 reviews, with the consensus: " Star Trek reignites a classic franchise with action, humor, a strong story, and brilliant visuals, and will please traditional Trekkies and new fans alike."  
 
 
 
 The editing, cinematography, and special effects work are state-of-the-art, as you'd expect – extra praise goes to an astonishingly detailed sound mix – but so are the same aspects of Wolverine , and that film's a joyless bore by comparison. What lifts the Abrams film into the ether is the rightness of its casting and playing, from Saldana's Uhura, finally a major character after all these years, to Urban's loyal, dyspeptic McCoy, to Simon Pegg's grandly comic Scotty, the movie's most radical reimagining of a Star Trek regular. 
 
 
 —Ty Burr of the Boston Globe  
 
 Ty Burr of the Boston Globe gave the film a perfect four star rating, describing it as "ridiculously satisfying", and the "best prequel ever".  
 The chemistry between Pine and Quinto was well received by critics. Gleiberman felt that as the film progressed to the conclusion, Pine and Quinto emulated the same connection as Kirk and Spock.  
 Some film critics were polarized with Star Trek . Keith Phipps of The A.V. Club gave the film a 'B+' grade, and asserted that it was "a reconsideration of what constitutes Star Trek , one that deemphasizes heady concepts and plainly stated humanist virtues in favor of breathless action punctuated by bursts of emotion. It might not even be immediately recognizable to veteran fans."  
 Accolades  
 The film garnered numerous accolades after its release. In 2010, it was nominated for four Academy Awards at the 82nd Academy Awards , for Best Sound Editing , Best Sound Mixing , Best Visual Effects , and Best Makeup . Star Trek won in the category for Best Makeup , making it the first Star Trek film to receive an Academy Award.  
 Star Trek received several nominations. The film was nominated for a Grammy Award for Best Score Soundtrack Album for a Motion Picture, Television or Other Visual Media , but was beaten out by Up , also composed by Michael Giacchino.
