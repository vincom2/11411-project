 Development of the film began with the cancellation of Spider-Man 4 in 2010, ending director Sam Raimi 's Spider-Man film series that had starred Tobey Maguire as the titular superhero . Opting to reboot the franchise with the same production team along with James Vanderbilt to stay on with writing the next Spider-Man film while Alvin Sargent and Steve Kloves helped with the script as well. During pre-production , the main characters were cast in 2010. New designs were introduced from the comics such as artificial web-shooters. Using Red Digital Cinema Camera Company 's RED Epic camera, principal photography started in December 2010 in Los Angeles before moving to New York City. The film entered post-production in April 2011. 3ality Technica provided 3D image processing, Sony Imageworks handled CGI and James Horner composed the film score .

Critical reaction was mostly positive, according to review aggregators Rotten Tomatoes and Metacritic , and the film was also nominated for several awards.

 Plot  
 A young Peter Parker discovers his father Richard Parker 's study has been burglarized. Gathering up hidden documents, Peter's parents take him to the home of his Aunt May and Uncle Ben , then mysteriously depart. 
 Years later, a teenaged Peter attends Midtown Science High School, where he is bullied by Flash Thompson and has caught the eye of the beautiful Gwen Stacy . At home, Peter finds his father's papers and learns he worked with fellow scientist Dr. Curt Connors at Oscorp. Sneaking into Oscorp, Peter enters a lab where a "biocable" is under development from genetically modified spiders , one of which bites him. On the subway ride home, he discovers that he has developed spider-like abilities. 
 After studying Richard's papers, Peter visits the one-armed Connors, reveals he is Richard Parker's son and gives Connors his father's "decay rate algorithm", the missing piece in Connors' experiments on regenerating limbs. Connors is being pressed by his superior, Dr. Ratha, to devise a cure for the dying (but unseen) head of Oscorp, Norman Osborn . In school, Peter gets into trouble after a basketball challenge with Flash in which Peter accidentally shatters the backboard glass. His uncle changes work shifts to meet with the principal and asks Peter to replace him walking home with Aunt May that night. Peter gets distracted and helps Connors regenerate the limb of a laboratory mouse. Peter's failure causes an argument with his uncle and he leaves. At a nearby deli, a cashier refuses to let Peter buy milk when Peter is two cents short; when a thief suddenly raids the store, Peter indifferently observes. While searching for Peter, Uncle Ben attempts to stop the thief and is killed. The thief escapes as Peter finds Ben on the sidewalk. 
 Afterward, Peter uses his new abilities to hunt criminals matching the killer's description. After a fall lands him inside an abandoned gym, a luchador -wrestling poster inspires him to create a mask to hide his identity. He adds a spandex suit and builds mechanical devices to attach to his wrists to shoot a biocable " web ". Peter accepts a dinner invitation from Gwen, where he meets and has a tense conversation with her father, police captain George Stacy , over Spider-Man's motives. After dinner, Peter reveals his identity to Gwen and they kiss. 
 After seeing success with the mouse using lizard DNA , Ratha demands Connors begin human trials immediately if Osborn is to survive. Connors refuses to rush the drug-testing procedure and put innocent people at risk. Ratha fires Connors and decides to test Connors' serum at a Veterans Administration hospital under the guise of a flu shot . In an act of desperation, Connors tries the formula on himself. After passing out, he awakens to find his missing arm has regenerated. Discovering that Ratha is on his way to the VA hospital, Connors, whose skin is turning green and scaly, goes to intercept him. By the time he gets to the Williamsburg Bridge Connors has become a violent hybrid of lizard and man, tossing cars, including Ratha's, over the side of the bridge. Peter, now calling himself Spider-Man, snatches each falling car with his web-lines. 
 Spider-Man suspects Connors is Lizard and unsuccessfully confronts the creature in the sewers. Lizard learns Spider-Man's real identity via the name on an abandoned camera and follows Peter to school where they fight. In response, the police start a manhunt for both Spider-Man and Lizard. The police corner Spider-Man and Captain Stacy discovers that he is really Peter. Lizard plans to make all humans lizard-like by releasing a chemical cloud from Oscorp's tower, to eliminate the weaknesses he believes plague humanity. Spider-Man eventually disperses an antidote cloud instead, restoring Connors and earlier victims to normal, but not before Lizard mortally wounds Captain Stacy. Before his death, Captain Stacy makes Peter vow to keep Gwen safe by leaving her out of it. Peter initially does so, but later at school suggests to Gwen he may see her again. 
 In a closing-credits scene , Connors, in a prison cell, speaks with a man in the shadows who asks if Peter knows the truth about his father. Connors replies, "No", and demands Peter be left alone before the man disappears. 2

 Themes and analysis  
 
 
 
 "I have tried to capture how Peter copes with the feelings of being an underdog, his confusions and his self-doubt. This, I hope, has brought, a certain empathy and sensitivity to his character that explains how it helps him become the hero that he eventually turns out to be." 
 
 
 —Andrew Garfield  
 
 Webb described the film as "a story about a kid who grows up looking for his father and finds himself."  
 Stone described her character as "a daddy's girl" who is very responsible and protective of her family and loves science.  
 
 
 
  
Rhys Ifans described the character that he is portraying as a villain as similar to Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde from the classic book of the same name. 
 
 
 Webb felt that the Lizard was the best villain because, "He's the literal embodiment of the theme of the movie, which is we all have a missing piece. He has no arm. Peter has no parents, and he fills that void with Spider-Man."  
 Webb said that Oscorp Tower is pivotal as a part of a new mythology of the film. He liked that Parker was connected to the building in some way and to think of it as "a Tower of Babel in the middle of Manhattan that has something dark and seedy going on in there."  
 Production  
 Development  
 Further information: Spider-Man in film#Spider-Man 4 
 Following the release of Spider-Man 3 , Sony Pictures Entertainment had announced a May 5, 2011, release date for Sam Raimi 's next film in the earlier series. By this time, screenwriters James Vanderbilt , David Lindsay-Abaire and Gary Ross had all written rejected versions of a script and Ziskin's husband Alvin Sargent , who wrote the second and third films, was working on yet another attempt.  
 Arad later explained, "We were working on what we called Spider-Man 4 and it was the same team  
 
 
 
 "When you walk out of the theater, I want the world you see to resemble what you saw on the screen. Part of the joy of cinema  you make the impossible look real. I wanted it to be more grounded and more realistic and that went for the emotion of the scenes, the physical action and wardrobe. It's less based in Steve Ditko world and probably closer visually and more influenced by " Ultimate Spider-Man " but it is also very much a world of our own devising." 
 
 
 —Marc Webb in an interview with the Los Angeles Times   
 
 Days after announcing Raimi's departure, the studio announced that Webb, whose previous film (500) Days of Summer was his directorial debut, would direct the reboot.

 In May 2010, The Hollywood Reporter said the actors who met with Webb to be considered for the lead role included Jamie Bell , Alden Ehrenreich , Frank Dillane, Garfield and Josh Hutcherson .  
 Sony then held auditions for the role of the young Peter, who needed to resemble Garfield.  
 It was reported originally that the film would feature both Mary Jane Watson and Gwen Stacy as love interests,  
 On October 11, 2010, Rhys Ifans was confirmed to be the unnamed villain, and two days later his character was revealed to be Dr. Curt Connors / The Lizard.  
 In November 2010, Martin Sheen was reported to be Uncle Ben while Sally Field was in negotiations to play Aunt May.  
 Design  
 Further information: Spider-Man's powers and equipment 
 Webb felt a responsibility to reinvent Spider-Man.  
 While Webb introduced a few elements from Ultimate Spider-Man , he wanted to keep the mainstream version of Gwen Stacy instead of that world's punk rocker.  
 The release of Lizard merchandise designs along with unconfirmed concept art featuring a humanoid-shape with a layer of scales on top instead of a pronounced snout (similar to a dinosaur or crocodile) as in the most recent comics, produced a mixed reaction. Many commenters compared it to other fictional characters instead of his rendering in comics.  
 Webb "wanted to do something that felt more contemporary, and was less based in representing panels from the comics" and focus on spirit over style.  
 Filming  
 
 
 
  
Some of the filming locations in New York City were near East River close to the Williamsburg Bridge as shown above. However, most of the action scenes could not be done there. A 150-foot replica of a piece of the bridge near a tank had to be replaced for some of the action scenes in Los Angeles and some tighter shots and close-ups were done on a soundstage in New York City.  
 
 
 Principal photography began on December 6, 2010, in Los Angeles.  
 Some location shooting took place in New York City. The Alexander Hamilton U.S. Custom House served as the exterior for NYPD headquarters, and an apartment house at 15 West 81st Street, on Manhattan's Upper West Side , was used as the exterior for the home of Gwen Stacy and her family. A row of houses on Fuller Place in the Brooklyn neighborhood of Windsor Terrace stood in for the Forest Hills, Queens neighborhood of Ben and May Parker. A web-swinging stunt sequence takes place along the Riverside Drive Viaduct in Harlem .  
 The film was the first Hollywood production to be filmed with the Red Digital Cinema Camera Company 's RED Epic camera and was shot in 3-D at 5K resolution.  
 On April 2011, Stone revealed that the cinematography had wrapped and that post-production began in May although some reshooting took place in New York City in November 2011 and in Los Angeles in December 2011.  
 Stunts  
 Webb stated that he and the crew wanted to keep the stunts more grounded physically, a challenge for a superhuman character.

 Critics like Filmtracks.com 's Christian Clemmensen felt that "Horner's mix of the electronic elements into the major ensemble cues is tastefully handled" in this score. He also felt that the instruments such as the piano like played in this score is one of the heart of the score following Parker's relationships in their tender and mysterious turns.

 Big Cola was reported to enter a deal for promoting the film.  
 As is common in Sony films, Sony product placements abounded, replacing the ubiquitous Apple Computer products often used by other studios. The film's mobile phones, tablets, monitors and laptops all came from other Sony divisions. Other placements included Microsoft 's Bing search engine.  
 Previews  
 
 
 &#160; 
 
  
The point of view shot in the teaser trailer that was compared to the 2009 first person video game, Mirror's Edge by writers. This was the first preview audiences had of Spider-Man fully in the new costume in video. Only a few of these scenes appeared in the final cut of the film. 
 
 
 A teaser trailer was leaked on the Internet and aired at San Diego Comic-Con International in July 2011, attached to the superhero film Captain America: The First Avenger .  
 A "sneak peek screening" of The Amazing Spider-Man was held on February 6, 2012 in 13 cities internationally: Berlin , London , Los Angeles, Madrid , Mexico City , Moscow , New York City, Paris , Rio de Janeiro , Rome , Seoul , Sydney and Tokyo .  
 A third official trailer debuted on iTunes on May 3, 2012. The trailer was attached to the 3D première of The Avengers , the day after.  
 In May 9, 2012 the first television trailer was revealed which teased an "4 minute Super Preview" on NBC with the season premiere of America's Got Talent on May 14.  
 A six-minute 3D preview was tied in with IMAX 3D showings of Men in Black 3 .  
 Viral campaign  
 
 
 
  
Graffiti of the Spider-Man logo in Seattle, Washington , painted by operatives for the viral campaign for The Amazing Spider-Man . 
 
 
 The main viral marketing site was revealed in the second trailer in February 2012.  
 A Daily Bugle website revealed Denis Leary as George Stacy, lamenting the appearance of the wall-crawler and asking whoever spots Spider-Man to e-mail the police. The site hosted the best fan-made Spider-Man scenes.  
 On May 30, 2012, the third (and apparently final) set of challenges in the Animal Dynamics Lab was launched with two new video updates of Doctor Connors, an image of Richard and Mary Parker, letters from Rajit Ratha to Doctor Connors, one from Doctor Connors to Richard Parker and another note to Richard from Mary.  
 Oliver Lyttleton of indieWire felt that viral ads such as the webbed menace website seemed a little forced and cribbed heavily from the example set by The Dark Knight with viral games.  
 Philanthropy  
 T-shirts depicting the film's Spider-Man to help the cause for Stand Up to Cancer were available. Garfield wore the shirt, explaining that "these shirts underscore the idea that anyone has the power to be a hero. Cancer is one of our greatest villains. I'm proud to join others in standing up to this disease."  
 Release  
 On February 10, 2010, Sony announced that the film would be released in 3D and IMAX 3D on July 3, 2012. Release dates outside the US were moved up to June in other countries to increase first-week sales.  
 Critical reception  
 
 
 
  
 The Amazing Spider-Man was the last Marvel Comics based film that Ebert ever reviewed before he died. He regarded it as "probably the second best" within the Spider-Man film franchise.  
 
 
 The Amazing Spider-Man received mostly positive reviews by critics upon release with critics praising the performance of Andrew Garfield . The review aggregator film site Rotten Tomatoes reported a 73% approval rating, based on 279 reviews, with an average rating of 6.7/10. The consensus: "A well-chosen cast and sure-handed direction allows The Amazing Spider-Man to thrill despite revisiting many of the same plot points from 2002's Spider-Man ."  
 Jordan Mintzer of The Hollywood Reporter felt that the film was satisfying, explaining that Webb directed with emotional and comedic touches and provided a darker depiction and a stronger romance than the original.  
 Lisa Schwarzbaum of Entertainment Weekly gave the film an A- describing the film as "a friskier, sweeter-natured variation" when compared to Raimi's work. She explained that the most "amazing" element was not the "blockbuster wow!" but instead the "intimate awww."  
 Joe Morgenstern of The Wall Street Journal , pointed out that "the truly amazing thing is that most of what happens to Peter Parker in the first half of the film has already happened in previous chapters of the Spidey saga", that "what's old is old again."  
 Andrew Garfield received good notices for his performance. Bob Mondello of NPR said, "Here comes another Spider-dude: This Andrew Garfield guy. So he'd better be really something, right? Well, as it happens, he is."  
 Box office  
 The Amazing Spider-Man earned $262,030,663 in North America and $490,185,894 in other countries, for a worldwide total of $752,216,557.  
 In North America, the film earned an estimated $7.5&#160;million during its midnight run at 3,150 locations, including $1.2&#160;million from 300 IMAX venues.  
 Outside North America, The Amazing Spider-Man grossed $51.1&#160;million on its five-day opening weekend (June 27 – July 1, 2012) from 13 markets, with strong openings in many Asian countries.
