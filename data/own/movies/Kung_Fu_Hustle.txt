 Plot  
 In Shanghai during the 1930s, Brother Sum, the leader of the Deadly Axe Gang , exercises control over the city, openly killing anyone who gets in his way. One day, two troublemakers, Sing and Bone, come to Pig Sty Alley impersonating members of the Axe Gang to gain respect. Their plan fails, and Sing's antics attract the real gang to the scene. In the massive brawl that ensues, more than fifty gangsters are defeated by three tenants who are incognito martial arts masters. 
 After the fight, Sing and Bone are apprehended by Brother Sum for publicly humiliating the Axe Gang. They are hung by their arms. Sing uses his lock picking skills to escape and ask to join the gang. Sum is impressed by Sing's lock picking, so he tells them that if they kill a person they will be accepted into the gang. Asked to explain his escape skills, Sing describes his childhood: he bought a Buddhist Palm manual from a beggar and trained himself to be a martial artist, but when he tried to defend a mute girl from bullies, he was beaten up and humiliated. 
 The next day, the duo return to Pig Sty Alley and attempt to murder the Landlady, but their efforts fail. The cantankerous Landlady chases Sing, who becomes badly injured in the process after being bitten on the lips by a snake and hides in a traffic control pulpit, where his multiple injuries including comically swollen lips spontaneously heal, a surprise even to him. 
 Meanwhile, Sum hires two mystical assassins to kill the three martial artists at Pig Sty Alley. That night, the Landlady, fearing retaliation from the Axe Gang, evicts the three martial artists. In the process of leaving, one of them is murdered by the assassins, who use a magical guqin as their weapon, and the other two attain serious injuries during a fight. The assassins are then defeated by the Landlady and Landlord, who are in fact martial arts masters in self-imposed retirement. Sensing an impending showdown with the Axe Gang, the Landlady and Landlord evacuate Pig Sty Alley. 
 Sing mugs an ice cream vendor, only to realize she is the mute girl from his childhood and for rescuing her, offers him the lollipop from when they were children. He refuses and knocks it away, shattering it to pieces. Sing berates Bone for being unhelpful in their quest to become Axe members and forces him away. Sing is then picked up by the Axe Gang and in exchange for joining the gang, Sum orders him to break into a mental asylum to free a legendary fighter known as The Beast. Sing succeeds and brings The Beast to Sum at his office. The Beast is initially flippant and his sloppy appearance bewilders Sum, who orders his men to torture the fighter. In response, The Beast stops a bullet with his bare hands, and the Axe Gang bows in respect. The Beast then confronts the Landlady and Landlord at the casino and they fight, with The Beast having the advantage. They manage to overpower him with a bell, through which the Landlady amplifies her lion's roar technique. Sing, having reformed, rushes in to help them by hitting The Beast with a table leg. The blow only incenses The Beast, who pummels Sing into the floor. Before he can deliver a final blow, the Landlord and Landlady grab him and flee. Sum angrily blames The Beast for letting them escape, and The Beast casually kills Sum and takes over his men. 
 At Pig Sty Alley, Sing undergoes a metamorphosis; The Beast's thrashing has awoken his true potential as a kung fu genius. He quickly recovers from his wounds, and suggests that the Landlord and Landlady rest. He easily defeats the Axe Gang before confronting The Beast. The two engage in a fierce brawl before The Beast uses his Toad technique to send Sing rocketing into the sky. As he falls back to earth, Sing comes to terms with the Buddha and the techniques he learned from the manual as a child, and delivers the Buddhist Palm to defeat the Beast. After a final failed attack on Sing, The Beast then accepts his defeat. 
 Some time later, Sing and Bone open a candy store with the vendor's lollipop as the store sign. When the mute ice cream vendor walks by, Sing goes out to meet her. The beggar (suspected to be a magical traveller) who gave Sing the Buddhist Palm is then seen attempting to sell the Buddhist Palm manual to a young boy. The boy turns to leave until the beggar offers a variety of manuals.

 Production  
 Development  
 
 
 
  
An early sketch of the Pig Sty Alley 
 
 
 Kung Fu Hustle is a co-production of the Beijing Film Studio and Hong Kong's Star Overseas.  
 Chow was inspired to create the film by the martial arts films he watched as a child and by his childhood ambition to become a martial artist.  
 Chow's first priority was to design the main location of the film, "Pig Sty Alley". Later in an interview Chow remarked that he had created the location from his childhood, basing the design on the crowded apartment complexes of Hong Kong where he had lived.  
 Casting  
 Kung Fu Hustle features several prolific Hong Kong action cinema actors from the 1970s. Yuen Wah , a former student of the China Drama Academy Peking Opera School who appeared in over a hundred Hong Kong films and was a stunt double for Bruce Lee , played the Landlord of Pig Sty Alley. Wah considered starring in Kung Fu Hustle to be the peak of his career. In spite of the film's success, he worried that nowadays fewer people practice martial arts.  
 Auditions for the role of the Landlady began in March 2003, Yuen Qiu who did not audition, was spotted, during her friend's screen test smoking a cigarette with a sarcastic expression on her face, which won her the part.  
 Bruce Leung , who played the Beast, was Stephen Chow's childhood martial arts hero.  
 In addition to famous martial artists, Kung Fu Hustle features legends of Chinese cinema . Two famous Chinese directors appear in the film: Zhang Yibai , who plays Inspector Chan at the beginning of the film, and Feng Xiaogang , who plays the boss of the Crocodile Gang.  
 In casting Sing's love interest Fong, Chow stated that he wanted an innocent looking girl for the role. Television actress Eva Huang , in her film debut, was chosen from over 8,000 girls. When asked about his decision in casting her Chow said that he "just had a feeling about her" and said that he enjoyed working with new actors. She chose to have no dialogue in the film so that she could stand out only with her body gestures.  
 Filming  
 
 
 
  
CGI construction of the Buddhist Palm 
 
 
 Filming took place in Shanghai from June 2003 to November 2003.  
 Most of the special effects in the film, created by Hong Kong computer graphics company Centro Digital Pictures Limited , which had previously worked on films such as Shaolin Soccer and Kill Bill , included a combination of computer-generated imagery and wire work . Centro Digital performed extensive tests on CGI scenes before filming started, and treatment of the preliminary shots began immediately afterwards. The CGI crew edited out wire effects and applied special effects in high resolution. Legendary martial arts mentioned in wuxia novels were depicted and exaggerated through CGI, but actual people were used for the final fight between Chow's character and hundreds of axe-wielding gangsters.  
 Music  
 Main article: Kung Fu Hustle (soundtrack) 
 The majority of the film's original score was composed by Raymond Wong and performed by the Hong Kong Chinese Orchestra .  
 Asian and American versions of the soundtrack were released. The Asian version of the soundtrack was released on 17 December 2004 by Sony Music Entertainment and has 33 tracks.  
 The soundtrack for the trailer was mastered at Epiphany Music and Recording, Inc. in Santa Rosa, California. 
 References to other works  
 Kung Fu Hustle makes references to a wide range of films, animated cartoons , wuxia novels and other sources. Sing and Bone resemble George Milton and Lennie Small from the 1992 film Of Mice and Men .  
 A major element of the plot is based on the wuxia film series Palm of Ru Lai (如來神掌), released in 1964.  
 
 
 
  
An aerial shot of Sing fighting the Axe Gang. The fight is reminiscent of The Matrix Reloaded . 
 
 
 References to gangster films are also present. The boss of the Axe Gang, Brother Sum (琛哥) is named after Hon Sam / Hon Sum (韓琛), the triad boss played by Eric Tsang in Infernal Affairs .  
 When Donut dies, he says, "In great power lies great responsibility", a reference to Spider-Man , said by Uncle Ben before his death.  
 The dialogue that the Beast says while negotiating with the Axe Gang for killing the Landlady and Landlord – "...then young friend, I will make an offer you cannot refuse", is a reference of the dialogue from the movie 'The Godfather'.  
 The final fight between Sing (who has been reborn into "the one", which pays homage to Bruce Lee by wearing his costume in Enter the Dragon and using his fighting style) and the hundreds of gangsters imitates the fight between Neo and hundreds of Agent Smiths in The Matrix Reloaded .  
 The last scene, in which the beggar tries to sell martial arts manuals, refers directly to the greatest skills in Louis Cha's Condor Trilogy ( Nine Yang Manual , "Yiyang Finger", and " Eighteen Dragon Subduing Palms "), "Thousand Hand Divine Fist", and The Smiling, Proud Wanderer (" Nine Swords of Dugu "). The scene in which the landlady confronts Brother Sum in the back of his car is a homage to Bruce Lee in Way of the Dragon , where he cracks his knuckles and gives a quick upper nod to the mafia boss, telling him to back off.

 Kung Fu Hustle premiered at the 2004 Toronto International Film Festival .  
 The North American DVD release was on 8 August 2005.
