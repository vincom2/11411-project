 Plot  
 Further information: Plot of the novel 
 13-year-old Harry Potter has been spending another miserable summer at Privet Drive . When Uncle Vernon 's sister, Marge , insults Harry's parents, he loses his temper and accidentally causes her to inflate and fly away. Harry flees with his luggage, fed up with his life with the Dursleys. The Knight Bus delivers Harry to the Leaky Cauldron , where Harry is let off the hook by Minister of Magic Cornelius Fudge for the use of magic outside Hogwarts . After reuniting with Ron and Hermione , Harry learns that Sirius Black , a convicted supporter of Voldemort , has escaped Azkaban prison, intending to kill Harry. 
 The trio return to Hogwarts on the Hogwarts Express . Dementors board the train during the journey, searching for Sirius, and enters the trio's compartment, prompting Harry to pass out. New Defense Against the Dark Arts professor Remus Lupin repels the Dementor with a Patronus Charm . At Hogwarts, Albus Dumbledore announces that dementors will be guarding the school while Sirius is at large. Hagrid is announced the new Care of Magical Creatures teacher. Hagrid's first class goes awry when Draco Malfoy deliberately provokes the hippogriff , Buckbeak , who attacks him (although it was kind to Harry). Draco's father Lucius Malfoy has Buckbeak sentenced to death. 
 Sirius is rumored to have entered the castle but isn't found. During a stormy Quidditch match, dementors overpower Harry, causing him to fall off his broomstick, which is then destroyed by the Whomping Willow . Lupin secretly teaches Harry to defend himself against dementors, using the Patronus charm. At Hogsmeade , a shocked Harry learns that Sirius is his godfather and was his parents' best friend. Sirius was accused of betraying the Potters' hiding location to Voldemort and murdering their mutual friend Peter Pettigrew . 
 The trio visit Hagrid to console him over Buckbeak's impending execution. When Ron's pet rat Scabbers escapes, a large dog appears and drags both Ron and Scabbers into a hole at the Whomping Willow's base, which is actually an underground passage to the Shrieking Shack . The trio discovers that the dog is actually Sirius, who is an Animagus . Lupin arrives and embraces Sirius as an old friend and helped him into the castle. Lupin admits to being a werewolf , and explains that Sirius is innocent. Scabbers is actually Pettigrew, an Animagus who committed the crime for which Sirius was convicted, much to Ron's surprise. After he was forced back into a human, Lupin and Sirius prepare to kill Pettigrew, but Harry intervenes; Pettigrew is instead to be turned over to the Dementors. 
 The full moon rises; Lupin transforms into a werewolf, he and Sirius fight in the animal forms, and Pettigrew escapes in his rat form. Sirius and Harry are attacked by dementors. Harry sees a figure save them by casting a powerful stag Patronus. He believes the mysterious figure is his dead father, and passes out, awakening to discover that Sirius has been captured and sentenced to the Dementor's Kiss . Acting on Dumbledore's advice, Harry and Hermione travel back in time, watching themselves repeat the night's events. They save Buckbeak and witness the Dementors overpower Sirius and Harry. The present Harry realizes that he himself was the one to cast the Patronus, not his father, and rushes to do so. Harry and Hermione then rescue Sirius, who escapes on Buckbeak. Lupin resigns, as parents will object to a werewolf teaching their children. Sirius sends Harry a Firebolt broom, and Harry happily takes it for a ride.

 Emma Watson as Hermione Granger , 
 
 
 Robbie Coltrane as Rubeus Hagrid , the Hogwarts gamekeeper and the new Care of Magical Creatures teacher. 
 Michael Gambon as Albus Dumbledore , the Hogwarts Headmaster. Gambon assumed the role after Richard Harris , who played Dumbledore in the previous two films, died on 25 October 2002.  
 Richard Griffiths as Vernon Dursley , Harry's Muggle uncle. 
 Gary Oldman as Sirius Black , an escapee from the Wizarding prison Azkaban and Harry's godfather. Oldman accepted the part because he needed the money, as he had not taken on any major work in several years as he had decided to spend more time with his children.  
 Alan Rickman as Severus Snape , the Potions master at Hogwarts . 
 Fiona Shaw as Petunia Dursley , Harry's Muggle aunt. 
 Maggie Smith as Minerva McGonagall , the Transfiguration teacher at Hogwarts.

 David Thewlis as Remus Lupin , the new Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher at Hogwarts. Thewlis, who had previously auditioned for the role of Professor Quirrell in Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone , was Cuarón's first choice for the role of Lupin. He accepted the role on advice from Ian Hart , the man who was cast as Quirrell, who told him that Lupin was "the best part in the book."  
 Emma Thompson as Sybill Trelawney , the Divination teacher at Hogwarts. 
 Julie Walters as Molly Weasley , the Weasley matriarch and a mother figure to Harry. 
 
 Production  
 Development  
 With Prisoner of Azkaban , production of the Harry Potter films switched to an eighteen-month cycle, which producer David Heyman explained was "to give each  
 Filming  
 
 
 
  
 Loch Shiel , where scenes from Prisoner of Azkaban were filmed. 
 
 
 Principal photography began on 24 February 2003,  
 Some sets for the film were built in Glen Coe , Scotland, near the Clachaig Inn . The indoor sets, including ones built for the previous two films, are mainly in Leavesden Film Studios. The Hogwarts Lake was filmed from Loch Shiel , Loch Eilt and Loch Morar in the Scottish Highlands. Incidentally, the train bridge, which was also featured in the Chamber of Secrets , is opposite Loch Shiel and was used to film the sequences when the Dementor boarded the train. A small section of the triple-decker bus scene, where it weaves in between traffic, was filmed in North London's Palmers Green . Some parts were also filmed in and around Borough Market and Lambeth Bridge in London. 
 The Honeydukes set in this film is a redress of the set of Flourish &amp; Blotts that was seen in Chamber of Secrets , which, in turn, was a redress of the Ollivanders set from the first film . 
 Rowling allowed Cuarón to make minor changes to the book, on the condition that he stuck to the book's spirit.  
 Effects  
 Cuarón originally wanted to move away from CGI toward puppetry. He hired master underwater puppeteer Basil Twist to help, using puppets to study the potential movement of the Dementors.  Once it became apparent that puppetry would be too expensive and unable to portray the specific elements of the Dementors, Cuarón turned to CGI; however, he and his team did use footage of Dementor puppets underwater as a basis for the flowing movements of the computer-generated Dementors. 
 The Knight Bus segment when Harry is being taken to The Leaky Cauldron uses the technique known as bullet time , popularised in The Matrix series of films. This segment takes humorous advantage of the magic quality of the Harry Potter world by having the Muggle world go into bullet time while inside the Knight Bus, Harry, Stan Shunpike and Ernie Prang (and the talking shrunken head) keep moving in real time. 
 Music  
 Main article: Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (soundtrack) 
 The Academy Award-nominated score was the third and final score in the series to be composed and conducted by John Williams . It was released on CD on 25 May 2004. In general, this film's music is not as bright as that of the previous films, with distinct medieval influences in the instrumentation. One of the new themes, "Double Trouble," was written during production so that a children's choir could perform it in Hogwarts's Great Hall in one of the film's earlier scenes. The lyrics of "Double Trouble" are from a ritual performed by the Weïrd Sisters in Act 4, Scene 1 of Shakespeare's Macbeth .  The film's trailer prominently features the cues "Anticipation" and "Progeny" by Brand X Music, a trailer music band. 
 Differences from the book  
 Prisoner of Azkaban was, at the time of publication, the series' longest book. The increasing plot complexity necessitated a looser adaptation of the book's finer plot lines and back-story. The film opens with Harry using magic to light his wand in short bursts, whereas in the same scene in the book, he uses a flashlight, as performing magic outside the wizard world is illegal for wizards under the age of seventeen. Also in the book, there is no shrunken head in the Knight Bus, while in the film, a rude shrunken head talks through most of the Knight Bus scene. The connection between Harry's parents and the Marauder's Map is only briefly mentioned,  
 On account of pace and time considerations, the film glosses over detailed descriptions of magical education. Only one Hippogriff, Buckbeak, is seen, and only Malfoy and Harry are seen interacting with the Hippogriff during Care of Magical Creatures lessons, and most other lessons, including all of Snape's potions classes, were cut from the film.  
 In the film, where Harry and Hermione have travelled back in time and are hiding outside of Hagrid's hut, it is heavily implied that Dumbledore somehow knows that they are there, as he distracts the other characters at key moments or slows down the proceedings (such as by suggesting that he sign Buckbeak's execution order as well, then after Fudge agrees he says it will take some time as he has an extremely long name), which allows Harry and Hermione time to free Buckbeak unseen. In the book, Dumbledore merely comments that the executioner must sign the order, right before he is about to leave the cabin to execute Buckbeak. 
 The embryonic romantic connection between Ron and Hermione is more prominent in the film than the book; in response to criticism of the first two films for sacrificing character development for mystery and adventure, the emotional development of all three lead characters is given more attention in the third film.  Also, Harry receives the Firebolt at the film's end, while in the book he receives it anonymously at Christmas and it is confiscated for a few weeks to be checked for possible jinxes by Professor Flitwick and Madam Hooch. 
 Distribution  
 Marketing  
 As with the series' previous instalments, Prisoner of Azkaban was a large merchandising opportunity.  
 Theatrical release  
 Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban held its New York premiere at Radio City Music Hall on 23 May 2004,  
 Reaction  
 Box office  
 Upon release, the film broke the record for biggest single day in the United Kingdom's box office history making £5.3 million on a Monday.  
 The Prisoner of Azkaban made a total of $796.6 million worldwide,  Despite its successful box office run, Azkaban is currently the lowest-grossing Harry Potter film (all the other Harry Potter films have grossed more than US$875 million worldwide). Still, Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban is currently the 44th-highest-grossing film of all time . 
 Critical reception  
 Prisoner of Azkaban earned notable critical acclaim, garnering a 91% "Certified Fresh" approval rating at the review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes with a consensus stating,"Under the assured direction of Alfonso Cuaron, Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban triumphantly strikes a delicate balance between technical wizardry and complex storytelling."  
 Mick LaSalle of the San Francisco Chronicle lauded the film's more mature tone and said it was "darker, more complex, rooted in character."  
 Rex Reed, of The New York Observer , pointed out some unnecessary stylistic changes, calling it "the silliest, as well as the most contrived – and confusing – of them all." 
 Accolades  
 Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban was nominated for Best Original Music Score ( John Williams ) and Best Visual Effects at the 77th Academy Awards held in 2005.  This was the second film in the series to be nominated for an Oscar . 
 The film also ranks at No. 471 in Empire magazine's 2008 list of the 500 greatest movies of all time.
