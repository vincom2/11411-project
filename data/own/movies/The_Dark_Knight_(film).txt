 Plot 
 In Gotham City , the Joker and his accomplices rob a mob-owned bank. The accomplices kill each other off one by one in a sequence masterminded by the Joker, who escapes alone with all the money. 
 Batman and Lt. Jim Gordon decide to include the new district attorney, Harvey Dent , in their plan to eradicate the mob. Although Dent is dating Rachel Dawes , Bruce Wayne is impressed with his idealism and offers to throw him a fundraiser. Mob bosses Sal Maroni , Gambol, and The Chechen hold a videoconference with Lau, a Chinese accountant who has hidden their funds and fled to Hong Kong . The Joker interrupts the meeting, warning that Batman is unhindered by jurisdiction. He offers to kill Batman for half their money, but the mob bosses refuse, and Gambol puts a bounty on him. The Joker kills Gambol and takes control of his men. Batman captures Lau and delivers him back to Gotham to testify against the Joker and the mob. 
 The Joker announces that people will die each day unless Batman reveals his identity. He then kills Commissioner Gillian B. Loeb and the judge presiding over the mob trials. He also targets Dent at the fundraiser, but Bruce hides Dent. Gordon foils the Joker's assassination attempt on Mayor Garcia, apparently sacrificing himself in the process. Bruce plans to reveal his identity, but Dent instead names himself as Batman to protect the truth. Dent is taken into protective custody and pursued by the Joker across the city; Batman rushes to Dent's aid. Gordon, who faked his death, helps apprehend the Joker and is promoted to Commissioner. 
 That night, Dent and Rachel disappear. Batman interrogates the Joker and discovers that Dent and Rachel are held in two separate buildings filled with explosives. The Joker reveals their locations, and Batman goes to Rachel's, only to realize that the Joker has tricked him into finding Dent moments before both buildings explode, killing Rachel and scarring half of Dent's face. The Joker detonates a bomb in the police station and escapes with Lau. 
 Coleman Reese, an accountant at Wayne Enterprises , deduces Batman's true identity and plans to reveal it. The Joker kills Lau and The Chechen, then threatens to bomb a hospital unless Reese is killed. Gordon and Bruce protect Reese, who changes his mind. The Joker visits Dent in the hospital and convinces him to seek revenge. The Joker then blows up the hospital and escapes with hostages. 
 Dent starts to go after people responsible for Rachel's death, deciding their fates by flipping a coin. He kills Maroni and a cop who had helped kidnap Rachel. It is revealed that the Joker rigged two ferries with explosives to escalate chaos; one ferry is full of citizens, the other full of prison inmates and guards. He then gives the passengers of each ferry the choice to blow the other up before midnight — otherwise, both ferries will explode. The passengers ultimately refuse. 
 Batman asks a reluctant Lucius Fox to use a city-wide tracking prototype device to find the Joker; Fox agrees, but says he will resign immediately afterward. The Joker dresses up hostages as his men, luring Gordon's SWAT team to strike them. Batman fights off the SWAT team and the Joker's men, then rescues the hostages. Batman apprehends the Joker, but the Joker gloats that he has won, as Gotham will lose hope once Dent's rampage becomes public. Before the SWAT team arrives to take the Joker into custody, he reminds Batman that their conflict will be eternal. 
 Dent lures Gordon to the building where Rachel died and holds Gordon's family hostage. Batman confronts Dent, who judges the fates of himself, Batman, and Gordon's son with three coin flips. He shoots Batman, spares himself, then flips again to determine the boy's fate. Batman, who is wearing body armor, tackles Dent off the building, killing him and saving the boy.  Batman then convinces Gordon to frame him for Dent's murders so that Dent will remain a symbol of hope for the city. Gordon destroys the Bat-Signal and launches a manhunt for the Batman. Alfred Pennyworth burns a letter written by Rachel to Bruce announcing her engagement to Dent, and Fox watches the signal tracker self-destruct.

 Gary Oldman as James Gordon : 
 
 
 A lieutenant in the Gotham City Police Department and one of the city's few honest police officers. He forms a tenuous, unofficial alliance with Batman and Dent.

While Stephens is an honest cop, Ramirez and Wuertz are in the pocket of the mob, and betray Harvey Dent and Rachel Dawes to the Joker. (Ramirez is drawn as a somewhat sympathetic character, however; she only started working for the mob because she was desperate to afford to her mother's hospital bills.) The cast also included Anthony Michael Hall as Gotham Cable News reporter Mike Engel, Nydia Rodriguez Terracina as Judge Janet Surrillo, Joshua Harto as Coleman Reese, Melinda McGraw and Nathan Gamble as Gordon's wife and son, and Tom "Tiny" Lister, Jr. as a prison inmate on one of the bomb-rigged ferries. The film's supporting villains include Michael Jai White and Ritchie Coster as mob bosses Gambol and The Chechen, respectively. William Fichtner played the Gotham National Bank manager. David Banner originally auditioned for the role of Gambol.  
 Musician Dwight Yoakam was approached for the roles of either the manager or a corrupt cop, but he chose to focus on his album Dwight Sings Buck .  
 Production 
 Development 
 
 
 
 "As we looked through the comics, there was this fascinating idea that Batman's presence in Gotham actually attracts criminals to Gotham,  attracts lunacy . When you're dealing with questionable notions like people taking the law into their own hands, you have to really ask, where does that lead? That's what makes the character so dark, because he expresses a vengeful desire." 
 
 
 —Nolan, on the theme of escalation  
 
 Before the release of Batman Begins , screenwriter David S. Goyer wrote a treatment for two sequels which introduced the Joker and Harvey Dent.  
 After much research, Nolan's brother and co-writer, Jonathan , suggested the Joker's first two appearances, published in the first issue of Batman (1940), as the crucial influences.  
 According to Nolan, an important theme of the sequel is "escalation," extending the ending of Batman Begins , noting "things having to get worse before they get better."  
 Filming 
 While scouting for shooting locations in October 2006, location manager Robin Higgs visited Liverpool , concentrating mainly along the city's waterfront. Other candidates included Yorkshire , Glasgow, and parts of London.  
 For fifteen years Nolan had wanted to shoot in the IMAX format, and he also used it for "quiet scenes which pictorially we thought would be interesting."

 Warner Bros. chose to film in Chicago for 13 weeks, because Nolan had a "truly remarkable experience" filming part of Batman Begins there.  
 Pinewood Studios , near London, was the primary studio space used for the production.  
 Filming took place in Hong Kong from November 6 to 11, 2007, at various locations in the CBD, including Hong Kong's tallest building at the time, the International Finance Centre , for the scene where Batman captures Lau.  
 Design 
 Costume designer Lindy Hemming described the Joker's look as reflecting his personality, in that "he doesn't care about himself at all"; she avoided designing him as a vagrant , but still made him appear to be "scruffier, grungier," so that "when you see him move, he's slightly twitchier or edgy."  
 Hemming and Ledger's Joker design has had an impact in popular and political culture in the form of the Barack Obama "Joker" poster , and has since become a meme in its own right.  
 Designers improved on the design of the Batsuit from Batman Begins , adding wide elastic banding to help bind the costume to Bale, and suggest more sophisticated technology. It was constructed from 200 individual pieces of rubber, fiberglass, metallic mesh, and nylon. The new cowl was modeled after a motorcycle helmet and separated from the neck piece, allowing Bale to turn his head left and right and nod up and down.  
 Effects

 The film introduces the Batpod , which is a recreation of the Batcycle. Production designer Nathan Crowley, who designed the Tumbler for Batman Begins , designed six models (built by special effects supervisor Chris Corbould ) for use in the film's production, because of necessary crash scenes and possible accidents.  
 Nolan designed Two-Face's appearance in the film as one of the least disturbing, explaining, "When we looked at less extreme versions of it, they were too real and more horrifying. When you look at a film like Pirates of the Caribbean &#160;– something like that, there's something about a very fanciful, very detailed visual effect, that I think is more powerful and less repulsive."  
 Music

 Batman Begins composers Hans Zimmer and James Newton Howard returned to score the sequel. Composition began before shooting, and during filming Nolan received an iPod with ten hours of recordings.

 WhySoSerious.com directed fans to find letters composing the Joker's message "The only sensible way to live in this world is without rules," to send in photographs of these letters, and then featured their photos in a collage. 
 
 
 In May 2007, 42 Entertainment began a viral marketing campaign utilizing the film's "Why So Serious?" tagline with the launch of a website featuring the fictional political campaign of Harvey Dent, with the caption, "I Believe in Harvey Dent."  
 During the 2007 San Diego Comic-Con International , 42 Entertainment launched WhySoSerious.com, sending fans on a scavenger hunt to unlock a teaser trailer and a new photo of the Joker.

 After the death of Heath Ledger on January 22, 2008, Warner Bros. adjusted its promotional focus on the Joker,  
 On May 15, 2008, Six Flags Great America and Six Flags Great Adventure theme parks opened The Dark Knight roller coaster , which cost US$7.5&#160;million to develop and which simulates being stalked by the Joker.  
 Warner Bros. devoted six months to an anti-piracy strategy that involved tracking the people who had a pre-release copy of the film at any one time. Shipping and delivery schedules were also staggered and spot checks were carried out both domestically and overseas to ensure illegal copying of the film was not taking place in cinemas.  
 
 Release 
 Warner Bros. held the world premiere for The Dark Knight in New York City on July 14, 2008, screening in an IMAX theater with the film's composers James Newton Howard and Hans Zimmer playing a part of the film score live.  
 In the United States and Canada, The Dark Knight was distributed to 4,366 theaters, breaking the previous record for the highest number of theaters held by Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End in 2007. The number of theaters also included 94 IMAX theaters, with the film estimated to be played on 9,200 screens in the United States and Canada.  
 Reception 
 
 
 
  
Heath Ledger's performance was praised and ultimately won him an Academy Award. 
 
 
 Based on 289 reviews collected by Rotten Tomatoes , the film received a 94% approval rating from critics, with an average score of 8.5/10.  
 Five days after the film's release, it sat on the No. 1 spot on Internet Movie Database 's list of top 250 movies of all time.  
 Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times , awarding four out of four stars, described The Dark Knight as a "haunted film that leaps beyond its origins and becomes an engrossing tragedy." He praised the performances, direction, and writing, saying the film "redefine 
 Emanuel Levy wrote Ledger "throws himself completely" into the role,  
 The Dark Knight was ranked the 15th greatest film in history on Empire 's 2008 list of the "500 Greatest Movies of All Time," based upon the weighted votes of 10,000 readers, 150 film directors, and 50 key film critics.  
 Commentary 
 Mystery writer Andrew Klavan , writing in The Wall Street Journal , compared the extreme measures that Batman takes to fight crime with those U.S. President George W. Bush used in the War on Terror . Klavan claims that, "at some level" The Dark Knight is "a paean of praise to the fortitude and moral courage that has been shown by George W. Bush in this time of terror and war." Klavan supports this reading of the film by comparing Batman—like Bush, Klavan argues—"sometimes has to push the boundaries of civil rights to deal with an emergency, certain that he will re-establish those boundaries when the emergency is past."  
 Themes and analysis 
 According to David S. Goyer, the primary theme of The Dark Knight is escalation.  
 Other critics have mentioned the theme of the triumph of evil over good. Harvey Dent is seen as Gotham's "White Knight" in the beginning of the film but ends up becoming seduced to evil.
