 Skyfall is the twenty-third James Bond film produced by Eon Productions . It was distributed by MGM and Sony Pictures Entertainment .  It features Daniel Craig in his third performance as James Bond , and Javier Bardem as Raoul Silva, the film's antagonist . The film was directed by Sam Mendes and written by Neal Purvis, Robert Wade and John Logan . 
 The film centres on Bond investigating an attack on MI6 ; the attack is part of a plot by former MI6 operative Raoul Silva to humiliate, discredit and kill M as revenge against her for betraying him. The film sees the return of two recurring characters to the series after an absence of two films: Q , played by Ben Whishaw , and Eve Moneypenny , played by Naomie Harris . Skyfall is the last film of the series for Judi Dench , who played M, a role that she had played in the previous six films. The position is subsequently filled by Ralph Fiennes ' character, Gareth Mallory . 
 Mendes was approached to direct the film after the release of Quantum of Solace in 2008. Development was suspended when MGM encountered financial troubles and did not resume until December 2010; during this time, Mendes remained attached to the project as a consultant. The original screenwriter, Peter Morgan , left the project during the suspension. When production resumed, Logan, Purvis, and Wade continued writing what became the final version of the script. Filming began in November 2011 and primarily took place in the United Kingdom, with smaller portions shot in China and Turkey. 
 Skyfall premiered in London at the Royal Albert Hall on 23 October 2012 and was released in the United Kingdom on 26 October 2012 and the United States on 9 November 2012. It was the first James Bond film to be screened in IMAX venues, although it was not filmed with IMAX cameras . The film's release coincided with the 50th anniversary of the Bond series, which began with Dr. No in 1962. Skyfall was positively received by critics and at the box office, becoming the 14th film, as well as the first Bond film, to cross the $1 billion mark worldwide. As of May 2013, it is the eighth-highest-grossing film of all time, the highest-grossing film in the UK , the highest-grossing film in the Bond series, the highest-grossing film worldwide for both Sony Pictures and MGM, and the second-highest-grossing film of 2012 . The film won several accolades, including two BAFTA Awards , two Academy Awards and two Grammys .

 Plot 
 In Istanbul MI6 agents James Bond and Eve Moneypenny chase a mercenary , Patrice, who has stolen a computer hard drive containing details of undercover agents placed in terrorist organisations by NATO states. Patrice wounds Bond in the shoulder and, as the two men fight atop a train, Eve inadvertently shoots Bond, allowing Patrice to escape. Bond falls into a river and goes missing, presumed to be dead. 
 In the aftermath of the operation, M , the head of MI6, comes under political pressure to retire from Gareth Mallory, the Intelligence and Security Committee Chairman. On her return from the meeting, MI6's servers are breached and M receives a taunting message via computer moments before the offices explode, killing a number of employees. MI6 relocates to its emergency offices underground. Bond, having used his supposed death to retire, learns of the attack and returns to London. Although he fails a series of physical and psychological examinations, M approves his return to the field. Shrapnel taken from Bond's shoulder wound helps identify Patrice, and intelligence places him in Shanghai, where he is planning an assassination. Bond is ordered to identify Patrice's employer, recover the stolen hard drive and kill Patrice. 
 In Shanghai Bond follows Patrice into a skyscraper, from which the latter shoots his target. He and Bond then begin to fight, but Patrice falls to his death before Bond can learn of his employer. Searching Patrice's equipment, Bond finds a gambling chip intended as payment for the assassination, which leads him to a casino in Macau . Bond is approached by Séverine, whom he witnessed as an accomplice in the assassination, and asks to meet the person for whom she and Patrice work. She warns him that he is about to be killed by her bodyguards, but promises to help Bond if he will kill her employer. Bond defeats his attackers and joins Séverine on her yacht . They travel to an abandoned island off the coast of Macau, where they are taken prisoner by the crew and delivered to Raoul Silva. A former MI6 officer who had previously worked under M, Silva has turned to cyberterrorism , orchestrating the attacks on MI6. Silva kills Séverine, but Bond overpowers his guards and captures Silva for removal to Britain. 
 At MI6's underground headquarters, Q attempts to decrypt Silva's laptop, but inadvertently enables it to access the MI6 systems, allowing Silva to escape from MI6 custody. Bond realises that Silva wanted to be captured as part of a plan to confront and kill M, whom he resents for leaving him to die after being captured years earlier. Bond gives chase through the tunnel network under London. Silva attacks M during a public inquiry into her handling of the stolen hard drive. Bond arrives in time to join Mallory and Eve in repelling Silva's attack, and M is hurried from the building by her aide, Bill Tanner . Bond drives M to Skyfall, his family estate and childhood home in Scotland. Laying a trap, he instructs Q to leave an electronic trail for Silva to follow, a decision Mallory supports. 
 Bond and M are met by Kincade, the Skyfall gamekeeper . The trio are only lightly armed, but they improvise a series of booby traps throughout the house. When Silva's men arrive, Bond, M and Kincade fight off the assault, although M is wounded. Silva arrives by helicopter to lead a much heavier second assault, and Bond sends M and Kincade off through a secret tunnel at the back of a priest hole to a chapel on the grounds. Bond detonates gas canisters with a stick of dynamite and retreats down the same tunnel as M and Kincade. The resulting blast causes the helicopter to crash, destroying the house and killing most of Silva's men. Silva survives and, spotting Kincade's torch beam, follows Kincade and M to the chapel. He forces his gun into M's hand, begging her to kill them both. Bond, having been delayed fighting Silva's henchmen, arrives and kills Silva by throwing a knife into his back, but M succumbs to her earlier wound and dies. Following M's funeral, Eve—formally introducing herself to Bond as Miss Moneypenny for the first time—retires from field work to become secretary for the new head of MI6, Mallory, who assumes the title of M.

 Production 
 Development 
 Production of Skyfall was suspended throughout 2010 because of MGM's financial troubles . They resumed pre-production following MGM 's exit from bankruptcy on 21 December 2010 and, in January 2011, the film was officially given a release date of 9 November 2012 by MGM and the Broccoli family, with production scheduled to start in late 2011. Subsequently MGM and Sony Pictures announced that the UK release date would be brought forward to 26 October 2012, two weeks ahead of the US release date, which remained scheduled for 9 November 2012.  
 Pre-production 
 After the release of Quantum of Solace in 2008, producer Barbara Broccoli commented that Skyfall , untitled at the time, may continue the plot of the Quantum organisation, introduced in Casino Royale and continued in Quantum of Solace .  Ultimately, Skyfall was a stand-alone film. 
 In August 2011 the Serbian newspaper Blic stated that Bond 23 would be entitled Carte Blanche and would be an adaptation of the recent continuation novel by Jeffery Deaver .  
 Casting 
 The main cast of Skyfall was officially announced at a press conference held at the Corinthia Hotel in London on 3 November 2011,  
 Ralph Fiennes was cast as Gareth Mallory,  
 Crew 
 
 
 
  
Director Sam Mendes at the film's premiere in Paris, October 2012 
 
 
 Skyfall was directed by Sam Mendes , who first signed on to the project shortly after Quantum of Solace was released, and remained on board as a consultant during the period of uncertainty surrounding MGM's financial situation. Mendes, who had previously worked with Craig on Road to Perdition , was approached after seeing Craig in a production of A Steady Rain . The two met after a performance, where Craig broached the subject of directing a Bond film for the first time.  
 Peter Morgan was originally commissioned to write a script, but left the project when MGM filed for bankruptcy and production of the film stalled; despite his departure, Morgan later stated that the final script was based on his original idea, retaining what he described as the film's "big hook".  
 Roger Deakins signed on as cinematographer, having previously worked with Mendes on Jarhead and Revolutionary Road .  
 Location scouting 
 Sam Mendes and Barbara Broccoli travelled to South Africa for location scouting in April 2011.  
 Filming 
 Principal photography was scheduled to take up 133 days,  
 
 
 
  
The Varda Viaduct was used for the scene in which Bond is shot. 
 
 
 Production moved to Turkey in March 2012, with filming reported to be continuing until 6 May.  
 Mendes confirmed that China would be featured in the film, with shooting scheduled to take place in Shanghai and "other parts" of the country.  
 Set reports dated April 2012 recorded that scenes would be set on Hashima Island , an abandoned island off the coast of Nagasaki , Japan.  
 The film was later converted into the IMAX format for projection in IMAX cinemas. Deakins was unaware that the film was to be released on IMAX until after he had made the decision to shoot the film with the Arri Alexa cameras, and was unhappy with the IMAX tests made from his footage as the colours "didn't look great".  
 Music 
 
 
 
  
 Thomas Newman composed the film's score. 
 
 
 Main article: Skyfall (soundtrack) 
 Thomas Newman , who worked with Sam Mendes as composer for American Beauty , Road to Perdition , Jarhead and Revolutionary Road , replaced David Arnold as composer,  
 The film also features Charles Trenet 's 1938 song, " Boum ! " during scenes in which Silva shows Bond around his abandoned island, and The Animals ' 1964 cover of John Lee Hooker 's song, " Boom Boom " when Silva assaults Skyfall in the film's finale.  
 In October 2012 British singer-songwriter Adele confirmed that she had written and recorded the film's theme song with her regular songwriter, Paul Epworth .  
 The song was nominated for and won the Academy Award for Best Original Song . It was the first time a Bond song had won, and only the fourth time one had been nominated.  
 Release and reception 
 The premiere of Skyfall was on 23 October 2012 at the Royal Albert Hall in London. The event was attended by Charles, Prince of Wales , and his wife Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall .  
 Skyfall attracted some criticism from the National Sexual Violence Resource Center which, without having screened the film, expressed concern that Bond "abuses his power and authority" in a scene that suggests Bond initiates sexual intercourse with Sévérine, a former victim of sex trafficking .  
 Box office 
 Skyfall has earned $1.1&#160;billion worldwide,

The UK DVD release of Skyfall was advertised by a train covered in 007 vinyls. 
 
 
 A number of reviewers praised Daniel Craig in Skyfall . Roger Ebert believed that in Skyfall "Daniel Craig  
 The supporting cast also received praise. Roger Ebert reflected that Skyfall "at last provides a role worthy of Judi Dench, one of the best actors of her generation. She is all but the co-star of the film, with a lot of screen time, poignant dialogue, and a character who is far more complex and sympathetic than we expect in this series".  
 Ann Hornaday, writing for The Washington Post , thought Sam Mendes had reinvigorated the series, with Skyfall being "sleek, crisp, classy&#160;... exhibiting just the right proportion of respect for legacy and embrace of novelty".  
 The film did not escape criticism, with reviews pointing to its two and a half-hour running time, and the final third of the film being "protracted", and not matching the first two thirds in its momentum as the underlying flaws in the film.
