 The King's Speech is a 2010 British historical drama film directed by Tom Hooper and written by David Seidler . Colin Firth plays King George VI who, to cope with a stammer , sees Lionel Logue , an Australian speech and language therapist played by Geoffrey Rush . The men become friends as they work together, and after his brother abdicates the throne , the new King relies on Logue to help him make his first wartime radio broadcast on Britain's declaration of war on Germany in 1939. 
 Seidler read about George VI's life after overcoming a stuttering condition he endured during his youth. He started writing about the relationship between the monarch and his therapist as early as the 1980s, but at the request of the King's widow, Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother , postponed work until her death in 2002. He later rewrote his screenplay for the stage to focus on the essential relationship between the two protagonists. Nine weeks before filming began, Logue's notebooks were discovered and quotations from them were incorporated into the script. 
 Principal photography took place in London and around Britain from November 2009 to January 2010. The opening scenes were filmed at Elland Road , Leeds and Odsal Stadium , Bradford , both locations standing in for the old Wembley Stadium . For indoor scenes, Lancaster House substituted for Buckingham Palace , and Ely Cathedral stood in for Westminster Abbey , while the weaving mill scene was filmed at the Queen Street Mill in Burnley . The cinematography differs from that of other historical dramas: hard light was used to give the story a greater resonance and wider than normal lenses were employed to recreate the King's feelings of constriction. A third technique Hooper employed was the off-centre framing of characters: in his first consultation with Logue, George VI is captured hunched on the side of a couch at the edge of the frame. 
 Released in the United Kingdom on 7 January 2011, The King's Speech was a major box office and critical success . Censors initially gave it adult ratings due to profanity, though these were later revised downwards after criticism by the makers and distributors in the UK and some instances of swearing were muted in the US. On a budget of £8&#160;million, it earned over $400&#160;million internationally (£250 million).  It was widely praised by film critics for its visual style, art direction, and acting. Other commentators discussed the film's representation of historical detail, especially the reversal of Winston Churchill 's opposition to abdication. The film received many awards and nominations, particularly for Colin Firth's performance; his Golden Globe Award for Best Actor was the sole win at that ceremony from seven nominations. The King's Speech won seven British Academy Film Awards , including Best Picture , and Best Actor (Firth), Best Supporting Actor (Rush), and Best Supporting Actress ( Helena Bonham Carter ). The film also won four Academy Awards: Best Picture , Best Director (Hooper), Best Actor (Firth), and Best Original Screenplay (Seidler).

 Plot  
 Prince Albert, Duke of York , the second son of King George&#160;V , stammers through his speech closing the 1925 British Empire Exhibition at Wembley Stadium , while the resulting ordeal is being broadcast by radio worldwide. The Duke has given up hope of a cure, but his wife Elizabeth persuades him to see Lionel Logue , an Australian speech therapist in London. During their first session, Logue breaches royal etiquette by referring to the Prince as "Bertie," a name used by his family. When the Duke decides Logue's methods and manner are unsuitable, Logue wagers a shilling that the Duke can recite Hamlet 's " To be, or not to be " soliloquy without trouble while listening to " The Marriage of Figaro " on headphones. Logue records his performance on an acetate record . Convinced he has stammered throughout, Prince Albert leaves in anger, declaring his condition "hopeless" and dismissing Logue. Logue offers him the recording as a keepsake.

 After King George&#160;V makes his 1934 Christmas radio address , he explains to his son the importance of broadcasting to a modern monarchy. He declares that "David" ( Edward, Prince of Wales ), Albert's older brother and the heir to the throne , will bring ruin to himself, the family, and the country when he accedes to the throne. King George demands that Albert train himself, starting with a reading of his father's speech. He makes an agonising attempt to do so. 
 Later, the Duke plays Logue's recording and hears himself unhesitatingly reciting Shakespeare. He decides to return to Logue, where he and his wife both insist that Logue focus only on physical exercises. Logue teaches his patient muscle relaxation and breath control techniques but continues to probe gently and persistently at the psychological roots of the stutter. The Duke eventually reveals some of the pressures of his childhood, and the two men start to become friends. 
 In January 1936, George&#160;V dies, and David ascends the throne as King Edward&#160;VIII, but causes a constitutional crisis with his determination to marry Mrs. Wallis Simpson , an American socialite divorcée who is still legally married to her second husband. At a party in Balmoral Castle , Albert points out that Edward, as head of the Church of England , cannot marry Mrs. Simpson, even if she receives her second divorce; Edward accuses his brother of wanting to usurp his place.

 At his next session, Albert expresses his frustration that while his speech has improved when talking to most people, he still stammers when talking to his own brother, and reveals the extent of Edward VIII's folly with Mrs. Simpson. When Logue insists that Albert could be a good king instead of his brother, the latter labels such a suggestion as treason , and in his anger, mocks and dismisses Logue. When King Edward&#160;VIII abdicates to marry Mrs. Simpson, Albert accedes as King George&#160;VI. The new King and Queen visit Logue at his home to apologise, startling Mrs. Logue, who was unaware that the new king was her husband's patient . 
 During preparations for his coronation in Westminster Abbey , George&#160;VI learns that Logue has no formal qualifications, as initially assumed by him. When confronted, Logue explains how he was asked to help shell-shocked Australian soldiers returning from the First World War. When George VI remains unconvinced of his fitness for the throne, Logue sits in King Edward's Chair and dismisses the underlying Stone of Scone as a trifle. Goaded by Logue's seeming disrespect, the King surprises himself with his own sudden burst of outraged eloquence. 
 Upon the declaration of war with Nazi Germany in September 1939, George&#160;VI summons Logue to Buckingham Palace to prepare for his upcoming radio address to millions of listeners in Britain and the Empire . Knowing the challenge that lies before him, both Winston Churchill and Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain offer the King their support. The King and Logue are then left in the room. He delivers his speech somewhat competently, while Logue guides him. By the end of his speech, George VI is speaking freely with little to no guidance from Logue. Afterwards, the King and his family step onto the balcony of the palace, and are applauded by the thousands who have gathered. 
 A title card explains that Logue was always present at King George&#160;VI's speeches during the war, and that they remained friends for the rest of their lives.

 Development  
 
 
 
 Not a great deal was written about His Majesty's speech therapist, Lionel Logue, certainly not in the official biographies. Nor was much published about the Royal stutter; it appeared to be a source of profound embarrassment.  
 
 
 — David Seidler 
 
 As a child, David Seidler developed a stammer, which he believes was caused by the emotional trauma of World War II and the murder of his grandparents during the Holocaust . King George VI's success in overcoming his stammer inspired the young Seidler, "Here was a stutterer who was a king and had to give radio speeches where everyone was listening to every syllable he uttered, and yet did so with passion and intensity." When Seidler became an adult, he resolved to write about King George VI. During the late 1970s and 1980s he voraciously researched the King, but found a dearth of information on Logue. Eventually Seidler contacted Dr. Valentine Logue, who agreed to discuss his father and make his notebooks available if the Queen Mother gave her permission. She asked him not to do so in her lifetime, and Seidler halted the project.  
 
 
 
  
The film's producers broke etiquette by hand-delivering Geoffrey Rush the script, but he liked it and eventually performed in and produced the film.  
 
 
 The Queen Mother died in 2002. Three years later, Seidler returned to the story during a bout of creative work inspired by a recovery from cancer. His research, including a chance encounter with an uncle whom Logue had treated, indicated he used mechanical breathing exercises combined with psychological counselling to probe the underlying causes of the condition. Thus prepared, Seidler imagined the sessions. He showed the finished screenplay to his wife, who liked it, but pronounced it too "seduced by cinematic technique". She suggested he rewrite it as a stage play to focus on the essential relationship between the King and Logue. After he had completed it, he sent it to a few friends who worked in theatre in London and New York for feedback.  
 In 2005, Joan Lane of Wilde Thyme, a production company in London, received the script. Lane started talking with Simon Egan and Gareth Unwin of Bedlam Productions , and they invited Seidler to London to rewrite the play again, this time for the screen. Together, Lane and Bedlam Productions organised a reading of the play in Pleasance Theatre , a small house in north London, to a group of Australian expatriates, among whom was Tom Hooper 's mother. She called her son and said, "I've found your next project".  
 Instead of trying to contact his agent, Lane asked an Australian staff member to hand-deliver the script to Geoffrey Rush's house, not far away from hers in Melbourne. Unwin reports that he received a four-page e-mail from Rush's manager admonishing them for the breach of etiquette, but ending with an invitation to discuss the project further. Iain Canning from See-Saw Films became involved and, in Gareth Unwin's words: "We worked with ex-chair of Bafta Richard Price, and started turning this story about two grumpy men sitting in a room into something bigger."  
 The production team learned—some nine weeks prior to the start of filming—of a diary containing Logue's original notes on his treatment of the Duke.  
 Seidler thought Paul Bettany would be a good choice to play King George&#160;VI, Tom Hooper preferred Hugh Grant , though both actors refused the offer. Once they met with Firth and heard him read for the part, Seidler and Hooper were convinced of his suitability for the role.  
 The UK Film Council awarded the production £1&#160;million in June 2009.  
 Location and design

 The set design presented a challenge for the film-makers: period dramas rely to an extent on the quality of production, but their budget was a relatively limited £8&#160;million. The film had to be authentic—combining regal opulence with scruffy, depression-era London.  
 On 26 November, a week's filming with Firth, Rush, and Jacobi began at Ely Cathedral , the location used for Westminster Abbey . The production had asked for permission to film in the Abbey but were denied due to the demands of tourism.  
 Lancaster House , an opulent, government-owned period house in London, was used for the interiors of Buckingham Palace that the King walks through prior to making his speech and for the official photograph afterwards; it cost £20,000 a day to rent.  
 The crew investigated Logue's former consultation rooms, but they were too small to film in. Instead, they found a high, vaulted room not far away in 33 Portland Place. Eve Stewart, the production designer, liked the mottled, peeling wallpaper there so much that she recreated the effect throughout the entire room.  
 The opening scene, set at the closing ceremony of the 1925 British Empire Exhibition at Wembley Stadium , was filmed on location at Elland Road , home of Leeds United , and Odsal Stadium , home of Bradford RLFC . Elland Road was used for the speech elements of the prince stammering his way through his first public address, and Odsal Stadium was selected because of the resemblance of its curved ends to Wembley Stadium in 1925.  
 Other locations include Cumberland Lodge , Harley Street , Knebworth , Hatfield House , the Old Royal Naval College in Greenwich , Queen Street Mill Textile Museum in Burnley , and Battersea Power Station , which doubled as a BBC wireless control room.  
 Dialogue  
 In developing his portrayal of George VI's stammer, Firth worked with Neil Swain, the voice coach for the film. His sister, Kate Firth , also a professional voice coach to actors, proposed exercises the King might have done with Logue, and made suggestions on how to imagine Logue's mix of physical and psychological coaching for the film.  
 Music  
 The film's original score was composed by Alexandre Desplat . In a film about a man struggling to articulate himself, Desplat was wary of overshadowing the dramaturgy, "This is a film about the sound of the voice. Music has to deal with that. Music has to deal with silence. Music has to deal with time."  The score was nominated for several awards, including Best Original Score at the Oscars, Golden Globes, and BAFTAs, winning the latter award. The score also won a Grammy at the 54th Grammys. 
 Visual style

 Hooper employed a number of cinematic techniques to evoke the King's feelings of constriction. He and cinematographer Danny Cohen used wider than normal lenses to photograph the film, typically 14mm, 18mm, 21mm, 25mm and 27mm, where the subtle distortion of the picture helps to convey the King's discomfort.  
 Roger Ebert noted that the majority of the film was shot indoors, where oblong sets, corridors, and small spaces manifest constriction and tightness, in contrast to the usual emphasis on sweep and majesty in historical dramas .  
 At other times, the camera was positioned very close to the actors to catch the emotion in their faces: "If you put a lens 6 inches from somebody's face, you get more emotion than if you're on a long lens 20 feet away," Cohen said in an interview.  
 Historical dramas traditionally tend to use "soft light", but Hooper wanted to use a harsher glare, which gives a more contemporary feel, and thus a greater emotional resonance. To achieve the effect, the lighting team erected huge blackout tents over the Georgian buildings, and used large lights filtered through Egyptian cotton.  
 Historical accuracy  
 The filmmakers not only tightened the chronology of the events to just a few years but even shifted the actual timeline of treatment: the Duke of York actually began work with Logue in October 1926, ten years before the abdication crisis , and the improvement in his speech was apparent in months rather than years, as is suggested by the film.  
 Hugo Vickers, an adviser on the film, agreed that the alteration of historical details to preserve the essence of the dramatic story was sometimes necessary. The high-ranking officials, for instance, would not have been present when the King made his speech, nor would Churchill have been involved at any level, "but the average viewer knows who Churchill is; he doesn't know who Lord Halifax and Lord Hoare are."

 Robert Logue, a grandson of Lionel, doubted the film's depiction of the speech therapist, stating "I don't think he ever swore in front of the King and he certainly never called him 'Bertie'".  
 Christopher Hitchens and Isaac Chotiner challenged the film's portrayal of Winston Churchill's role in the abdication crisis.  
 Martin Filler acknowledged that the film legitimately used artistic licence to make valid dramatic points, such as in the probably-imagined scene when George V lectures his son on the importance of broadcasting. Filler cautions that George VI would never have tolerated Logue addressing him casually, nor swearing, and the King almost certainly would have understood a newsreel of Hitler speaking in German. Filler makes the larger point that both the King and his wife were, in reality, lukewarm towards Churchill because of the latter's support for his brother during the abdication crisis. They only warmed to Churchill later in the war, because of his performance as a wartime leader.  
 Commenting on the film's final scene on the balcony of Buckingham Palace, Andrew Roberts has written, "The scene is fairly absurd from a historical point of view – Neville Chamberlain and Winston Churchill were not present and there were no cheering crowds outside Buckingham Palace."

 Cinema release  
 The film had its world premiere on 6 September 2010 at the Telluride Film Festival in the United States.  
 The film was distributed by Transmission in Australia and by Momentum Pictures in the United Kingdom. The Weinstein Company distributed it in North America, Germany, Benelux , Scandinavia, China, Hong Kong, and Latin America.  
 Ratings controversy  
 The film was initially given a 15 certificate by the British Board of Film Classification , due to scenes where Logue encourages the King to shout profanities to relieve stress. At the London Film Festival, Hooper criticised the decision, questioning how the board could certify the film "15" for bad language but allow films such as Salt (2010) and Casino Royale (2006) to have "12A" ratings, despite their graphic torture scenes. Following Hooper's criticism, the board lowered the rating to "12A", allowing children under 12 years of age to see the film if they are accompanied by an adult.  
 In January 2011 Harvey Weinstein , the executive producer and distributor, said he was considering having the film re-edited to remove some profanity, so that it would receive a lower classification and reach a larger audience.  The PG-13 version of this film is not available on DVD and Blu-ray. 
 Reception  
 
 Box office  
 In the UK and Ireland , the film was the highest earning film on its opening weekend. It took in £3,510,000 from 395 cinemas. The Guardian said that it was one of the biggest takes in recent memory, and compared it to Slumdog Millionaire (2008), which, two years earlier, earned £1.5&#160;million less.  
 In the United States The King's Speech opened with $355,450 (£220,000) in four cinemas. It holds the record for the highest per-cinema gross of 2010.  
 In Australia The King's Speech made more than A$ 6,281,686 (£4&#160;million) in the first two weeks, according to figures collected by the Motion Picture Distributors Association of Australia. The executive director of Palace Cinemas , Benjamin Zeccola, said customer feedback on the film was spectacular. "It's our No.1 for all the period, all throughout the country.&#160;... I think this is more successful than Slumdog Millionaire and a more uplifting film. It's a good example of a film that started out in the independent cinemas and then spread to the mainstream cinemas."  
 Of the film's net profit, estimated to amount to $30–40&#160;million (£20–25&#160;million) from the cinema release alone, roughly 20% will be split between Geoffrey Rush (as executive producer), Tom Hooper and Colin Firth, who receive their bonuses before the other stakeholders. The remaining profit is to be split equally between the producers and the equity investors.  
 Critical response  
  
 
 
 
 As the actor of the year in the film of the year, I can't think of enough adjectives to praise Firth properly. The King's Speech has left me speechless.  
 
 
 —Rex Reed, New York Observer 
 
 The King's Speech has received widespread critical acclaim.  
 Manohla Dargis , whilst generally ambivalent towards the film, called the lead performances one of its principal attractions. "With their volume turned up, the appealing, impeccably professional Mr. Firth and Mr. Rush rise to the acting occasion by twinkling and growling as their characters warily circle each other before settling into the therapeutic swing of things and unknowingly preparing for the big speech that partly gives the film its title," she wrote.  
 The British Stammering Association welcomed the release of The King's Speech , congratulating the film makers on their "realistic depiction of the frustration and the fear of speaking faced by people who stammer on a daily basis." It said that "Colin Firth's portrayal of the King's stammer in particular strikes us as very authentic and accurate."  
 Allociné , a French cinema website, gave the film an average of four out of five stars, based on a survey of 21 reviews.  
 Queen Elizabeth II , the daughter and successor of King George VI, was sent two copies of the film before Christmas 2010. The Sun newspaper reported she had watched the film in a private screening at Sandringham House . A palace source described her reaction as being "touched by a moving portrayal of her father".
