 Star Wars , later retitled Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope ,  written and directed by George Lucas . It is the first installment in the Star Wars series. The film stars Mark Hamill , Harrison Ford , Carrie Fisher , Peter Cushing and Sir Alec Guinness . In the film, a group of freedom fighters known as the Rebel Alliance plot to destroy the powerful Death Star space station, a devastating weapon created by the evil Galactic Empire . This conflict disrupts the isolated life of farmboy Luke Skywalker when he inadvertently acquires the droids carrying the stolen plans to the Death Star. After the Empire begins a cruel and destructive search for the droids, Skywalker decides to accompany Jedi Knight Obi-Wan Kenobi on a daring mission to rescue the owner of the droids, rebel leader Princess Leia , and save the galaxy. 
 Lucas began writing the script to Star Wars after completing his previous film American Graffiti and based the plot outline on Akira Kurosawa 's The Hidden Fortress . Lucas approached Alan Ladd, Jr. after United Artists and Universal Pictures rejected his script and the project was planned to be financed and released through 20th Century Fox . During this time, the script underwent numerous changes and Lucas founded Industrial Light &amp; Magic to create the visual effects for the film. Filming began on March 22, 1976, and was shot in various locations in Tunisia , England and Guatemala . During production, Lucas and the crew encountered numerous problems such as weather problems, malfunctioning equipment, as well as budgetary concerns. Eventually, Lucas, along with producer Gary Kurtz and production supervisor Robert Watts , split the crew into three units to meet the studio's deadlines. During post production, sound designer Ben Burtt used various animal roars, cables and other sound effects to create an "organic soundtrack" and composer John Williams used leitmotifs in his score at Lucas' requests. 
 Star Wars was released theatrically in the United States on May 25, 1977. The film earned $460&#160;million in the United States and $314 million overseas, surpassing Jaws as the nominal highest-grossing film , and it remained that way until being surpassed by E.T. the Extra Terrestrial in 1983. When adjusted for inflation, it is the second-highest-grossing film in the US and Canada and is the third-highest-grossing in the world as of 2013. Among the many awards the film received, it gained ten Academy Award nominations, winning six; the nominations included Best Supporting Actor for Alec Guinness and Best Picture . The film is often ranked as one of the best science fiction films . The film has since been preserved into the National Film Registry by the Library of Congress in its first year of opening (being the most recent one to do so at the time), with its accompanying soundtrack joining it into the National Recording Registry 15 years later, both being called "culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant." Lucas has re-released the film on several occasions, sometimes with significant changes ; the most notable versions are the 1997 Special Edition, the 2004 DVD release, and the 2011 Blu-ray release, which have modified computer-generated effects, altered dialogue, re-edited shots, remixed soundtracks, and added scenes. Following the film's massive success in 1977, it spawned two sequels, The Empire Strikes Back (1980) and Return of the Jedi (1983), both of which became box office successes and received positive reviews. A prequel trilogy was released between 1999 and 2005. A sequel trilogy is in development, with most of the film's main cast planned to return for Star Wars Episode VII in 2015.

 Plot  
 The galaxy is in a civil war and spies for the Rebel Alliance have stolen plans to the Galactic Empire's Death Star , a heavily armed and armored space station capable of destroying an entire planet. Rebel leader Princess Leia is in possession of the plans, but her ship is captured by Imperial forces under the command of the evil lord Darth Vader . Before she is captured, Leia hides the plans in the memory of an Astromech droid called R2-D2 , along with a holographic recording. The small droid flees to the surface of the desert planet Tatooine with fellow protocol droid C-3PO . 
 The droids split up and are later captured by Jawa traders, who sell the pair to moisture farmers Owen and Beru Lars and their nephew, Luke Skywalker . While Luke is cleaning R2-D2, he accidentally triggers part of Leia's message, in which she requests help from Obi-Wan Kenobi . The only "Kenobi" Luke knows of is an old hermit named Ben Kenobi who lives in the nearby hills. The next morning, Luke finds R2-D2, who fled the night before to seek Obi-Wan, and meets Ben Kenobi, who reveals himself to be Obi-Wan. Obi-Wan tells Luke of his days as a Jedi Knight , one of a faction of former galactic peacekeepers who were wiped out by the Empire. Contrary to his uncle's statements, Luke learns that his father Anakin Skywalker fought alongside Obi-Wan as a Jedi Knight before he was betrayed and killed by Vader, Obi-Wan's former pupil who turned to the " dark side of the Force ". Ben then offers Luke his father's lightsaber . 
 Obi-Wan views Leia's complete message in which she begs him to take the Death Star plans to her home planet of Alderaan for her father to retrieve and analyze. He then asks Luke to accompany him and learn the ways of the Force. Luke initially declines, but changes his mind after discovering that Imperial stormtroopers have destroyed his home and killed his aunt and uncle in search of C-3PO and R2-D2. Obi-Wan and Luke hire smuggler Han Solo and his Wookiee first mate Chewbacca to transport them on their ship, the Millennium Falcon . 
 Upon the Falcon ' s arrival at Alderaan, they find out that the planet has been destroyed under the orders of the Death Star's commanding officer Grand Moff Tarkin to intimidate Leia into revealing the hidden base of the Rebellion and to demonstrate the Death Star's power. The Falcon is captured by the nearby Death Star's tractor beam and brought into its hangar bay. While Obi-Wan goes to disable the tractor beam, Luke discovers that Leia is imprisoned on board and, with the help of Han and Chewbacca, rescues her. After several harrowing escapes, they make their way back to the Falcon , but Obi-Wan engages in a lightsaber duel with Vader at the expense of his own life. The Falcon escapes the Death Star but the Empire has placed a tracking device on the ship to follow them to the rebels' hidden base on Yavin IV . 
 The rebels analyze the Death Star plans, disclosing a vulnerable exhaust port leading to the station's main reactor. Luke joins the assault team, but Han collects his reward for the rescue and plans to leave despite Luke asking him to stay. During the Battle of Yavin, the rebels begin to deplete and suffer heavy losses after several unsuccessful attack runs, leaving Luke one of the few surviving pilots. Vader and a group of TIE fighters are about to attack Luke's ship, but Han Solo returns and destroys the TIE Fighters and the blast sends Vader spiraling away. Luke (with spiritual guidance from Obi-Wan to use the Force) successfully destroys the Death Star seconds before it can fire on the rebel base. Luke and Han are later awarded medals by Leia for their heroism.

 History  
 Writing  
 Elements of the history of Star Wars are commonly disputed, as Lucas' statements about it have changed over time.  Lucas even made an attempt to purchase the rights to remake Flash Gordon at one point, but could not afford them. 
 Following the completion of THX 1138 , Lucas was granted a two-film development deal with United Artists at the Cannes Film Festival in May of that year for American Graffiti , and an idea for a space opera he called The Star Wars . He showed United Artists the script for American Graffiti , but they passed on the film. Universal Studios picked the film up,  
 Lucas began his creation process by taking small notes, inventing odd names and assigning them possible characterizations. Lucas would discard many of these by the time the final script was written, but he included several names and places in the final script or its sequels (such as Luke Skywalker and Han Solo). He revived others decades later when he wrote his prequel trilogy (such as Mace Windy, renamed Windu ). He used these initial names and ideas to compile a two-page synopsis titled "The Journal of the Whills", which bore little resemblance to the final story.  
 Both United Artists and Universal passed on their options for the film later that year, citing the risk involved in the project's potentially high budget. Lucas pursued Alan Ladd, Jr. , the head of 20th Century Fox , and in June 1973 closed a deal to write and direct the film. Although Ladd did not grasp the technical side of the project, he believed that Lucas was talented. Lucas later stated that Ladd "invested in me, he did not invest in the movie."  The deal afforded Lucas $150,000 to write and direct. 
 
 
 
  
An Alaskan Malamute dog. George Lucas based Chewbacca on his dog, Indiana, which happened to be an Alaskan Malamute . The dog's name would later be used as inspiration for Indiana Jones . 
 
 
 Later that year, Lucas began writing a full script of his synopsis, which he would complete in May 1974. In this script he reintroduced the Jedi, which had been absent in his previous treatment, as well as their enemies, the Sith. He changed the protagonist, who had been a mature General in the treatment, to an adolescent boy, and he shifted the General into a supporting role as a member of a family of dwarfs .  
 Many of the final elements in the film began to take shape, though the plot  The script was also the first time Darth Vader appeared in the story, though other than being a villain, he bore little resemblance to the final character. 
 Lucas grew distracted by other projects, but he would return to complete a second draft of The Star Wars by January 1975; while still having some differences in the characters and relationships. For example, the protagonist Luke (Starkiller in this draft) had several brothers, as well as his father who appears in a minor role at the end of the film. The script became more of a fairy tale quest as opposed to the more grounded action-adventure of the previous versions. This version ended with another text crawl which previewed the next story in the series. This draft was also the first to introduce the concept of a Jedi turning to the dark side; a historical Jedi that became the first to ever fall to the dark side, and then trained the Sith to use it. Lucas hired conceptual artist Ralph McQuarrie to create paintings of certain scenes around this time. When Lucas delivered his screenplay to the studio, he included several of McQuarrie's paintings.  
 A third draft, dated August 1, 1975, was titled The Star Wars: From the Adventures of Luke Starkiller which now had most of the elements of the final plot, with only some differences in the characters and settings. Luke was again an only child, and his father was, for the first time, written as dead. This script would be re-written for the fourth and final draft, dated January 1, 1976 as The Adventures of Luke Starkiller as taken from the Journal of the Whills. Saga I: Star Wars . Lucas worked with his friends Gloria Katz and Willard Huyck to revise the fourth draft into the final pre-production script.  
 Lucas has often stated that the entire original trilogy was, in essence, intended as one film. However, he said that his story material for The Star Wars was too long for one film, so he opted to split the story into multiple films.  
 Casting  
 Lucas shared a joint casting session with long-time friend Brian De Palma , who was casting his own film Carrie . As a result, Carrie Fisher and Sissy Spacek auditioned for both films in each other's respective roles. Lucas favored casting young actors without long-time experience. While reading for Luke Skywalker (then known as "Luke Starkiller"), Hamill found the dialogue to be extremely odd because of its universe-embedded concepts. He chose to simply read it sincerely and was selected instead of William Katt , who was subsequently cast in Carrie .  
 
 
 
  
Anthony Daniels, the chosen actor to portray C-3PO, was convinced to take the role after seeing a design drawing of the character's face 
 
 
 Lucas initially rejected the idea of using Harrison Ford, as he had previously worked with him on American Graffiti , and instead asked Ford to assist in the auditions by reading lines with the other actors and explaining the concepts and history behind the scenes that they were reading. Lucas was eventually won over by Ford's portrayal and cast him instead of Kurt Russell , Nick Nolte ,  
 Many young actresses in Hollywood auditioned for the role of Princess Leia, including Cindy Williams  
 Production  
 In 1975, Lucas founded the visual effects company Industrial Light &amp; Magic (ILM) after discovering that 20th Century Fox's visual effects department had been disbanded. ILM began its work on Star Wars in a warehouse in Van Nuys, California . Most of the visual effects used motion control photography , which creates the illusion of size by employing small models and slowly moving cameras. Model spaceships were constructed on the basis of drawings by Joe Johnston , input from Lucas, and paintings by McQuarrie. Lucas opted to abandon the traditional sleekness of science fiction by creating a "used universe" in which all devices, ships, and buildings looked aged and dirty.  
 
 
 
  
A traditional underground building in Matmâta , Tunisia was used as a set for Luke's home on Tatooine. 
 
 
 When principal photography began on March 22, 1976 in the Tunisian desert for the scenes on the planet Tatooine , the project faced several problems.  Actor Kenny Baker later confessed that he thought the film would be a failure. Harrison Ford found the film "weird" in that there was a Princess with buns for hair and what he called a "giant in a monkey suit" named Chewbacca. 
 Lucas clashed with cinematographer Gilbert Taylor , BSC , whom producer Gary Kurtz called "old-school" and "crotchety". Moreover, with a background in independent filmmaking , Lucas was accustomed to creating most of the elements of the film himself. His lighting suggestions were rejected by an offended Taylor, who felt that Lucas was overstepping his boundaries by giving specific instructions and sometimes even moving lights and cameras himself. Taylor refused to use the soft-focus lenses and gauze Lucas wanted after Fox executives complained about the look.  
 Fox executive Alan Ladd, Jr. offered Lucas some of the only support from the studio; he dealt with scrutiny from board members over the rising budget and complex screenplay drafts. After production fell two weeks behind schedule, Ladd told Lucas that he had to finish production within a week or he would be forced to shut down production. The crew split into three units, led by Lucas, Kurtz, and production supervisor Robert Watts . Under the new system, the project met the studio's deadline.  
 
 
 
  
Mayan ruins at Tikal , Guatemala, which were used in the film as the rebel base. 
 
 
 During production, the cast attempted to make Lucas laugh or smile as he often appeared depressed. At one point, the project became so demanding that Lucas was diagnosed with hypertension and exhaustion and was warned to reduce his stress level.  
 Post-production  
 Star Wars was originally slated for release in Christmas 1976; however, delays pushed the film's release to summer 1977. Already anxious about meeting his deadline, Lucas was shocked when editor John Jympson 's first cut of the film was a "complete disaster". According to an article in Star Wars Insider No. 41 by David West Reynolds, this first edit of Star Wars contained about 30–40% different footage from the final version. This included scenes that have never been seen elsewhere along with alternate takes of existing scenes. After attempting to persuade Jympson to cut the film his way, Lucas replaced him with Paul Hirsch and Richard Chew. He also allowed his then-wife Marcia Lucas to aid the editing process while she was cutting the film New York, New York with Lucas's friend Martin Scorsese . Richard Chew found the film had an unenergetic pace; it had been cut in a by-the-book manner: scenes were played out in master shots that flowed into close-up coverage. He found that the pace was dictated by the actors instead of the cuts. Hirsch and Chew worked on two reels simultaneously; whoever finished first moved on to the next.  
 Meanwhile, Industrial Light &amp; Magic was struggling to achieve unprecedented special effects. The company had spent half of its budget on four shots that Lucas deemed unacceptable.  
 During the chaos of production and post-production, the team made decisions about character voicing and sound effects . Sound designer Ben Burtt had created a library of sounds that Lucas referred to as an "organic soundtrack". Blaster sounds were a modified recording of a steel cable, under tension, being struck. For Chewbacca's growls, Burtt recorded and combined sounds made by dogs, bears, lions, tigers and walruses to create phrases and sentences. Lucas and Burtt created the robotic voice of R2-D2 by filtering their voices through an electronic synthesizer. Darth Vader 's breathing was achieved by Burtt breathing through the mask of a scuba regulator implanted with a microphone.  
 In February 1977 Lucas screened an early cut of the film for Fox executives, several director friends, as well as Roy Thomas and Howard Chaykin of Marvel Comics who were preparing a Star Wars comic book . The cut had a different crawl from the finished version and used Prowse's voice for Darth Vader. It also lacked most special effects; hand-drawn arrows took the place of blaster beams, and when the Millennium Falcon fought TIE Fighters, the film cut to footage of World War II dogfights .  
 Cinematic and literary allusions  
 See also: Star Wars sources and analogues 
 
 
 
  
 
 
  
 War films such as the The Dam Busters and 633 Squadron which used aircraft like the Avro Lancaster (top) and the De Havilland Mosquito (bottom), respectively, were inspirations for the battle sequences. 
 
 
 
 According to Lucas, the film was inspired by numerous sources, such as Beowulf and King Arthur for the origins of myth and world religions.  
 Star Wars was influenced by the 1958 Kurosawa film The Hidden Fortress ; for instance, the two bickering peasants evolved into C-3PO and R2-D2, and a Japanese family crest seen in the film is similar to the Imperial Crest. Star Wars also borrows heavily from another Kurosawa film, Yojimbo . In both films, several men threaten the hero, bragging how wanted they are by authorities. The situation ends with an arm being cut off by a blade. Kuwabatake Sanjuro (portrayed by Toshiro Mifune ) is offered "twenty-five ryo now, twenty-five when you complete the mission", whereas Han Solo is offered "Two thousand now, plus fifteen when we reach Alderaan." Lucas's affection for Kurosawa may have influenced his decision to visit Japan in the early 1970s, leading some to believe he borrowed the name "Jedi" from jidaigeki (which in English means "period dramas", and refers to films typically featuring samurai ).  
 Tatooine is similar to Arrakis from Frank Herbert 's book Dune . Arrakis is the only known source of a longevity drug called the Spice Melange . References to " spice ", various illegal stimulant drugs, occur throughout the last three films of the Star Wars saga. In the original film, Han Solo is a spice smuggler who has been through the spice mines of Kessel . In the conversation at Obi-Wan Kenobi's home between Obi-Wan and Luke, Luke expresses a belief that his father was a navigator on a spice freighter. Other similarities include those between Princess Leia and Princess Alia /  ə  ˈ  l  iː  ə  / , and between Jedi mind tricks and "The Voice", a controlling ability used by Bene Gesserit . In passing, Uncle Owen and Aunt Beru are "moisture farmers"; in Dune , dew collectors are used by Fremen to "provide a small but reliable source of water."  
 The Death Star assault scene was modeled after the film The Dam Busters (1955), in which Royal Air Force Lancaster bombers fly along heavily defended reservoirs and aim " bouncing bombs " at their man-made dams to cripple the heavy industry of the Ruhr . Some of the dialogue in The Dam Busters is repeated in the Star Wars climax; Gilbert Taylor also filmed the special effects sequences in The Dam Busters . In addition, the sequence was partially inspired by the climax of the film 633 Squadron (1964) directed by Walter Grauman ,  
 The opening shot of Star Wars , in which a detailed spaceship fills the screen overhead, is a nod to the scene introducing the interplanetary spacecraft Discovery One in Stanley Kubrick 's seminal 1968 film 2001: A Space Odyssey . The earlier big-budget science fiction film influenced the look of Star Wars in many other ways, including the use of EVA pods and hexagonal corridors. The Death Star has a docking bay reminiscent of the one on the orbiting space station in 2001 .

Original vinyl release 
 
 
 On the recommendation of his friend Steven Spielberg , Lucas hired composer John Williams , who had worked with Spielberg on the film Jaws , for which he won an Academy Award . Lucas felt that the film would portray visually foreign worlds, but that the musical score would give the audience an emotional familiarity. In March 1977, Williams conducted the London Symphony Orchestra to record the Star Wars soundtrack in twelve days.  
 Lucas wanted a grand musical sound for Star Wars , with leitmotifs to provide distinction. Therefore, he assembled his favorite orchestral pieces for the soundtrack, until John Williams convinced him that an original score would be unique and more unified. However, a few of Williams' pieces were influenced by the tracks given to him by Lucas. The "Main Title Theme" was inspired by the theme from the 1942 film Kings Row , scored by Erich Wolfgang Korngold , and the track "Dune Sea of Tatooine" drew from the soundtrack from Bicycle Thieves , scored by Alessandro Cicognini. The American Film Institute's list of best scores lists the Star Wars soundtrack at number one.  
 Releases  
 Charles Lippincott was hired by Lucas's production company, Lucasfilm Ltd. , as marketing director for Star Wars . As 20th Century Fox gave little support for marketing beyond licensing T-shirts and posters, Lippincott was forced to look elsewhere. He secured deals with Marvel Comics for a comic book adaptation and with Del Rey Books for a novelization. A fan of science fiction, he used his contacts to promote the film at the San Diego Comic-Con and elsewhere within fandom . Worried that Star Wars would be beaten out by other summer films, such as Smokey and the Bandit , 20th Century Fox moved the release date to the Wednesday before Memorial Day : May 25, 1977. However, fewer than forty theaters ordered the film to be shown. In response, 20th Century Fox demanded that theaters order Star Wars if they wanted an eagerly anticipated film based on a best-selling novel titled The Other Side of Midnight .  
 Within three weeks of the film's release, 20th Century Fox's stock price doubled to a record high. Before 1977, 20th Century Fox's greatest annual profits were $37,000,000; in 1977, the company earned $79,000,000. Although the film's cultural neutrality helped it to gain international success, Fox executive Alan Ladd, Jr. became anxious during the premiere in Japan. After the screening, the audience was silent, leading him to fear that the film would be unsuccessful. Ladd was later told by his local contacts that, in Japan, silence was the greatest honor to a film and the subsequent strong box office returns confirmed its popularity. When Star Wars made an unprecedented second opening at Mann's Chinese Theatre on August 3, 1977 after Sorcerer failed, thousands of people attended a ceremony in which C-3PO, R2-D2, and Darth Vader placed their footprints in the theater's forecourt.  
 By August 1977 Star Wars was playing in 1,096 theaters in the United States.  LucasFilm distributed a "Birthday Cake" poster to those theaters for special events on May 25, 1978, the one-year anniversary of its release. 
 In 1978, at the height of the film's popularity, Smith-Hemion Productions approached Lucas with the idea of Star Wars Holiday Special . The result is often considered a failure; Lucas himself disowned it.  
 The film was originally released as Star Wars , without "Episode IV" or the subtitle A New Hope  The film was re-released theatrically in 1978, 1979, 1981, 1982, and with additional scenes and enhanced special effects in 1997. 
 Fox owned full rights to the original film until they sold it to Lucas in 1998 in exchange for a lower distribution fee for the prequels and broadcast rights to Episode I .  
 Special Edition  
 
 
 
  
"Han Shot First" T-shirts were inspired after a change in the special edition of the film that was controversial for some fans. 
 
 
 After ILM used computer-generated effects for Steven Spielberg's Jurassic Park , Lucas concluded that digital technology had caught up to his original vision for Star Wars .  
 Although the Special Edition ' s changes were artistic, A New Hope required extensive restoration before Lucas could even attempt his modifications. It had been discovered that in addition to the negative motion picture stocks commonly used on feature films, Lucas had also used internegative film, a reversal stock which deteriorated faster than negative stocks did. This meant that the entire printing negative had to be disassembled, and the CRI (color reversal internegative) portions cleaned separately from the negative portions. Once the cleaning was complete, the film was scanned into the computer for restoration. In many cases, entire scenes had to be reconstructed from their individual elements. Fortunately, digital compositing technology allowed them to correct for problems such as alignment of mattes, "blue-spill", and so forth.  
 The film was then color-corrected and digitally printed onto a new negative, from which prints would be struck. 
 Home video releases  
 The film was released on VHS, Betamax , V2000 and Laserdisc during the 1980s and 1990s by CBS/Fox Video .  It was subsequently re-released in 1985, and again every year from 1987–1990. In 1990 it was released in its original widescreen format on VHS in a box set and 1991 for European markets. A further release in 1993 on Laserdisc entitled "The Definitive Collection" which was initially issued with an timing error missing a few seconds of The Empire Strikes Back and then re-pressed correcting the error. A european digitally remastered re-release in 1994 followed and finally a THX remastered tape got on the market in 1995 which featured a censored version of A New Hope removing a few frames of blast hits to officers and troops to reduced the impact and flare. The THX remasters with a brand new sound mix by Ben Burtt were the last time the original theatrical trilogy would be issued with the tag lines "The Original Star Wars Trilogy - One Last Time" and "Get them before they're gone". However the very final release of the theatrical trilogy came in the form of a metal tin box set that was limited to 30,000 copies worldwide and entitled the ISD: Executor box set which was to be released in the September of 1995 - but the release had to be put back due to a shipping problem where a large number of the tins were damged in transit and recalled. The limited number that weren't damaged were shipped and sold at a very high price at retail. 
 Then after the loss of the original theatrical trilogy - it followed two years later by the reworked versions in a Star Wars Trilogy: Special Edition box set.  
 A New Hope was released on DVD on September 21, 2004, in a box set with The Empire Strikes Back , Return of the Jedi , and a bonus disc of supplementary material. The movies were digitally restored and remastered, and more changes were made by George Lucas. The DVD features a commentary track from George Lucas, Ben Burtt, Dennis Muren, and Carrie Fisher. The bonus disc contains the documentary Empire of Dreams : The Story of the Star Wars Trilogy , three featurettes, teasers, theatrical trailers, TV spots, still galleries, an exclusive preview of Revenge of the Sith , a playable Xbox demo of the LucasArts game Star Wars: Battlefront , and a "Making Of" documentary on the Episode III video game .  
 The trilogy was re-released on separate two-disc Limited Edition DVD sets from September 12 to December 31, 2006, and again in a limited edition tin box set on November 4, 2008;  A further box set was released including slimline versions of the 2004 Special Edition in a white box set with Luke Skywalker on the cover. 
 All six Star Wars films were released on Blu-ray Disc on September 16, 2011 in three different editions, with A New Hope available in both a box set of the original trilogy,  The original theatrical versions of the films were not included in the box set.

 Reaction  
 
 
 
 "On opening day I ... did a radio call-in show ... this caller, was really enthusiastic and talking about the movie in really deep detail. I said, 'You know a lot about the film.' He said, 'Yeah, yeah, I've seen it four times already.'" 
 
 
 —Producer Gary Kurtz, on when he realized Star Wars had become a cultural phenomenon  
 
 Star Wars debuted on Wednesday, May 25, 1977, in 32 theaters, and eight more on Thursday and Friday. It immediately broke box-office records, effectively becoming one of the first blockbuster films, and Fox accelerated plans to broaden its release.  
 The Special Edition was released on January 31, 1997 to a highly anticipated audience. However, the newly enhanced digital effects and new changes were a diversive addition to a large number of long serving fans which have been heavily debated ever since. 
 Box office  
 Star Wars remains one of the most financially successful films of all time. The film earned $1,554,475 through its opening weekend ($6.05&#160;million in today's terms), building up to $7 million weekends as it entered wide release ($27.2&#160;million in today's terms).  
 Following the release of the Special Edition in 1997,  
 Critical response  
 Star Wars was critically acclaimed. The film review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes sampled 70 reviews and judged 93% of them to be positive. Its consensus states in summary, "A legendary expansive and ambitious start to the sci-fi saga, George Lucas opens our eyes to the possibilities of blockbuster film-making and things have never been the same."  
 Conversely, Pauline Kael of The New Yorker criticized the film, stating that "there's no breather in the picture, no lyricism", and that it had no "emotional grip".

 Critic Roger Ebert wrote, "Like The Birth of a Nation and Citizen Kane , Star Wars was a technical watershed that influenced many of the movies that came after."  
 After seeing Star Wars , director James Cameron quit his job as a truck driver to enter the film industry. Other filmmakers who have said to have been influenced by Star Wars include Peter Jackson , Dean Devlin , Roland Emmerich , Christopher Nolan , John Lasseter , David Fincher , Kevin Smith , John Singleton , and Ridley Scott .  
 Some critics have blamed Star Wars and also Jaws for ruining Hollywood by shifting its focus from "sophisticated" films such as The Godfather , Taxi Driver , and Annie Hall to films about spectacle and juvenile fantasy.  
 In an opposing view, Tom Shone wrote that through Star Wars and Jaws , Lucas and Spielberg "didn't betray cinema at all: they plugged it back into the grid, returning the medium to its roots as a carnival sideshow, a magic act, one big special effect", which was "a kind of rebirth".  
 Honors  
 In 1989, the U.S. National Film Registry of the Library of Congress selected the film as a "culturally, historically, or aesthetically important" film.

 Marketing  
 Novelization  
 Main article: Star Wars: From the Adventures of Luke Skywalker 
 The novelization of the film was published in December 1976, six months before the film was released. The credited author was George Lucas, but the book was revealed to have been ghostwritten by Alan Dean Foster , who later wrote the first Expanded Universe novel, Splinter of the Mind's Eye . The book was first published as Star Wars: From the Adventures of Luke Skywalker ; later editions were titled simply Star Wars (1995) and, later, Star Wars: A New Hope (1997), to reflect the retitling of the film. Certain scenes deleted from the film (and later restored or archived in DVD bonus features) were always present in the novel (since it had been based on the screenplay), such as Luke at Tosche Station with Biggs and the encounter between Han and Jabba the Hutt in Docking Bay 94. Other deleted scenes from the movie, such as a close-up of a stormtrooper riding on a dewback , were included in a photo insert added to later printings of the book. 
 Smaller details were also different from the film version; for example, in the Death Star assault, Luke's callsign is Blue Five instead of Red Five as in the film. Also Obi-Wan does not sacrifice himself; Vader actually defeats and executes him in the lightsaber duel. Charles Lippincott secured the deal with Del Rey Books to publish the novelization in November&#160;1976 &#160;( 1976-11 ) . By February&#160;1977 &#160;( 1977-02 ) , a half-million copies had been sold.  
 Toys  
 Little Star Wars merchandise was available for several months after the film's debut; only Kenner Toys had accepted Lippincott's licensing offers. Kenner responded to the sudden demand for toys by selling boxed vouchers in its "empty box" Christmas campaign. Television commercials told children and parents that vouchers within a "Star Wars Early Bird Certificate Package" could be redeemed for 4 action figures "between February 1 and June 1".  
 Following the limted sales of the Early Bird Certificate sets - a further 17 action figures were released between April 1978 – 1979. And a multitude of vehicles from the movie with action playsets. 
 Comic book  
 Main article: Star Wars (Marvel Comics) 
 Marvel Comics adapted Star Wars as the first six issues of its licensed Star Wars comic book, with the first issue dated May 1977. Roy Thomas was the writer and Howard Chaykin was the artist of the adaptation; like the novelization, it contained certain elements, such as the scene with Luke and Biggs, that appeared in the screenplay but not in the finished film.  
 In 2013, Dark Horse Comics began to publish a comic adaption of the plot of the original screenplay. 
 Book-and-record sets  
 Lucasfilm adapted the story for a children's book-and-record set . Released in 1979, the 24-page Star Wars read-along book was accompanied by a 33⅓ rpm 7-inch gramophone record . Each page of the book contained a cropped frame from the movie with an abridged and condensed version of the story. The record was produced by Buena Vista Records , and its content copyrighted by Black Falcon, Ltd., a subsidiary of Lucasfilm "formed to handle the merchandising for Star Wars ".  
 The Story of Star Wars was a 1977 record album presenting an abridged version of the events depicted in Star Wars , using dialogue and sound effects from the original film. The recording was produced by George Lucas and Alan Livingston, and was narrated by Roscoe Lee Browne . The script was adapted by E. Jack Kaplan and Cheryl Gard. 
 Radio drama  
 Main article: Star Wars (radio) 
 A radio drama adaptation of the film was written by Brian Daley , directed by John Madden , and produced for and broadcast on the American National Public Radio network in 1981. The adaptation received cooperation from George Lucas , who donated the rights to NPR. John Williams' music and Ben Burtt's sound design were retained for the show; Mark Hamill (Luke Skywalker) and Anthony Daniels (C-3PO) reprised their roles as well. The radio drama featured scenes not seen in the final cut of the film, such as Luke Skywalker's observation of the space battle above Tatooine through binoculars, a skyhopper race, and Darth Vader's interrogation of Princess Leia. In terms of Star Wars canon , the radio drama is given the highest designation (like the screenplay and novelization), G-canon .
