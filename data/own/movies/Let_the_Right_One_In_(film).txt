 Let the Right One In ( Swedish : Låt den Rätte Komma In ) is a 2008 Swedish romantic horror film directed by Tomas Alfredson . Based on the 2004 novel of the same title by John Ajvide Lindqvist , who also wrote the screenplay. The film tells the story of a bullied 12-year-old boy who develops a friendship with a vampire child in Blackeberg , a suburb of Stockholm , in the early 1980s. Alfredson, unconcerned with the horror and vampire conventions , decided to tone down many elements of the novel and focus primarily on the relationship between the two main characters. Selecting the lead actors involved a year-long process with open castings held all over Sweden. In the end, then 11-year-olds Kåre Hedebrant and Lina Leandersson were chosen for the leading roles. They were subsequently commended by both Alfredson and film reviewers for their performances. 
 The film received widespread international critical acclaim and won numerous awards, including the "Founders Award for Best Narrative Feature" at the 2008 Tribeca Film Festival and the European Fantastic Film Festivals Federation 's 2008 Méliès d'Or (Golden Méliès ) for the "Best European Fantastic Feature Film", as well as four Guldbagge Awards from the Swedish Film Institute and the Saturn Award for Best International Film .

 Plot  
 Oskar, a meek 12-year-old boy, resides with his mother Yvonne in the western Stockholm suburb of Blackeberg in 1981 and occasionally visits his father Erik in the countryside. It is not clear why Erik is living apart from Yvonne, but on one such visit, when Oskar and Erik are enjoying a cosy night in playing games, a drunken neighbour arrives and Erik starts to drink heavily with him, breaking up the cosy father/son evening. Oskar collects clippings from newspapers and magazines about grisly murders and pictures of hunting knives. He keeps a large hunting knife under his mattress. 
 Oskar's classmates regularly bully him, and he spends his evenings imagining revenge. One night, he meets Eli, who appears to be a pale girl of his age. Eli has recently moved into the next-door apartment to Oskar with an older man, Håkan. Eli initially informs Oskar that they cannot be friends. However, over time, they begin to form a close relationship, with Oskar lending his Rubik's Cube to Eli, and the two exchanging Morse code messages through their adjoining wall. Håkan requests that Eli stop seeing Oskar. After questioning Oskar about a cut on his cheek, Eli learns from Oskar about his being bullied by schoolmates and encourages him to stand up for himself. This inspires Oskar to enroll for weight-training classes after school. 
 Meanwhile the otherwise well-prepared Håkan stops and kills a passerby on a busy footpath near a main road to harvest fresh blood for Eli. But he fails to return with any when he is interrupted by an oncoming dog walker. Eli subsequently waylays and kills a local man, Jocke, making his drunken way home from a bar after having said goodnight to his best friend, Lacke. A local cat-loving recluse, Gösta, witnesses the attack from his flat, but hardly believes what he has seen. Håkan hides Jocke's body in an ice-hole in the local lake. Håkan later makes another well-prepared, but incompetently executed effort to obtain blood for Eli by trapping a teenage boy in a changing room after school. The boy's friends are waiting for him to emerge, and go to see what is holding him up. Before he is discovered, Håkan pours concentrated hydrochloric acid onto his own face, disfiguring it to prevent the authorities from identifying him and tracing Eli. Eli learns that Håkan has been taken to the hospital and scales the building to access his restricted room. Håkan opens the window for Eli and offers his neck to Eli for feeding. After Eli has fed, Håkan falls out the window. He lays on the snow supposedly breathing his last breaths. Now alone, Eli goes to Oskar's apartment and spends the night with him, during which time they agree to "go steady". While Eli states, "I'm not a girl", Oskar ignores this. 
 During an ice skating field trip at a pond, some of Oskar's fellow students discover Jocke's body, hidden by Håkan. At the same time, Oskar finally stands up to his tormentors. He strikes the leader of the bullies, Conny, on the side of the head with a pole, splitting his ear. Some time later, Oskar shows Eli a private place he knows. Unaware that Eli is a vampire, Oskar suggests that they form a blood bond , and cuts his hand, asking Eli to do the same. Eli, thirsting for blood but not wanting to harm Oskar, laps up his spilt blood before running away. 
 Gösta tells his neighbours that he saw a young girl attack Jocke. They urge him to tell the police, but he does not. In a drunken state, Lacke tells his friends that Jocke was his only friend. His girlfriend, Virginia ( Ika Nord ) leaves but is attacked by Eli. Lacke turns up in time to interrupt the attack. Virginia survives, but she soon discovers that she has become painfully sensitive to sunlight. Thirsting for blood, she pays a visit to Gösta, only to be fiercely attacked by his many cats. In the hospital, Virginia, who has realized what she has become, asks an orderly to open the blinds in her room. When the sunlight streams in, she bursts into flames. 
 Upon the realization of Eli's true nature, Oskar confronts Eli, who admits to being a vampire. Their trust for each other grows and Eli appears in front of his apartment. When Oskar questions the consequences of Eli entering without his expressed verbal invitation, Eli passes the threshold to his apartment and begins to profusely bleed until Oskar panics and cries out a verbal invitation. After their embrace, Oskar is initially upset by Eli's need to kill people for survival. However, Eli insists their bloodthirsty natures are alike, wherein Oskar wants to kill and Eli needs to kill, and encourages Oskar to "be me, for a little while." Afterwards, Eli changes out of bloody clothes and Oskar, deciding to sneak a peek, is horrified when he sees a scar where Eli's genitalia should be. Eli quickly leaves his apartment through his window when his mother returns home. 
 Lacke, who has lost everything because of Eli, seeks out Håkan and Eli's apartment. He is suspicious of the apartment with the makeshift covered up windows. Breaking in, he discovers Eli asleep in the bathtub. Lacke holds a knife to Eli's neck while Eli is still sleeping. Oskar, who was hiding inside the apartment, sees what Lacke is doing and takes out his own knife. When Lacke finds it hard to see and lets sunlight into the room, Oskar shouts and Eli wakes up. A startled Lacke turns and throws his knife away when he sees Oskar. Eli immediately jumps on Lacke and kills him, feeding on his blood. Eli thanks Oskar and kisses him in gratitude. However, an upstairs neighbour is angrily knocking on the ceiling due to the disturbance the fight has caused. Eli realises that it is no longer safe to stay and leaves the same night. 
 The next morning, Oskar receives a phone call from Conny's friend, Martin, who lures Oskar out to resume the after-school fitness program at the local swimming pool. The bullies, led by Conny and his sadistic older brother Jimmy, start a fire to draw Mr. Ávila, the teacher in charge, outside. While Ávila is distracted, they storm the pool-area and order the other children to clear out, which leaves Oskar trapped alone in the pool. Jimmy forces Oskar under the water, threatening to stab his eye out if he does not hold his breath for three minutes. While Oskar is underwater, however, heard above the surface is a crash followed by screaming. Martin's feet are seen dangling just under the surface of the water as he is dragged over the pool, and shortly after he is suddenly pulled out of the water, his severed head falls into the pool. Soon afterward, Jimmy's right arm, which held Oskar underwater, is torn-off, and falls into the water. Eli then immediately pulls Oskar out of the water, and they both smile as they look into each other's eyes. The decapitated bodies of Martin, Jimmy, and Conny lie around the pool, while Andreas, the reluctant fourth bully, sobs on a bench. 
 Later, Oskar is traveling on a train with Eli in a box beside him, safe from sunlight. From inside, Eli taps the word "kiss" to Oskar in Morse code, to which he taps back " puss " (small kiss in Swedish).

 Production  
 Development  
 
 
 
  
The characteristic subway station of Blackeberg , which features in the film 
 
 
 The film project started in late 2004 when John Nordling, a producer at the production company EFTI, contacted Ajvide Lindqvist's publisher Ordfront to acquire the rights for a film adaption of Ajvide Lindqvist's novel. "At Ordfront they just laughed when I called, I was like the 48th they put on the list. But I called John Ajvide Lindqvist and it turned out we had the same idea of what kind of film we should make. It wasn't about money, but about the right constellation".  
 In addition to EFTI, co-producers included Sveriges Television and the regional production-centre Filmpool Nord. The production of the film involved a total budget of around 29 million SEK , including support from the Swedish Film Institute and Nordisk Film- &amp; TV Fond.  
 Screenplay  
 Lindqvist had insisted on writing the screenplay himself. Alfredson, who had no familiarity with the vampire and horror genres,  
 A key passage in the novel details what happens when a vampire enters a room uninvited, an action that traditional vampire lore usually prohibits.  
 The novel presents Eli as an androgynous boy, castrated centuries before by a sadistic vampire nobleman. The film handles the issue of Eli's gender more ambiguously: a brief scene in which Eli changes into a dress offers a glimpse of a suggestive scar but no explicit elaboration.  
 Casting  
 
 
 "Both Kåre and Lina who plays the leading parts are extremely intelligent, have exceptional integrity and are both kinds of strange old people. (...) It took us a year to find them, and I think they’re unprecedentedly fantastic."
 —Tomas Alfredson, director  
 
 
 
 Casting of the lead actors took almost a year,  
 Alfredson has described the casting process as the most difficult part of making the film.  
 In the end, Alfredson expressed satisfaction with the result, and has frequently lauded Hedebrant and Leandersson for being "extremely intelligent",  
 Filming  
 
 
 
  
The absence of ceilings made various overhead lighting techniques possible. 
 
 
 Although the film takes place in Blackeberg , a suburb of Stockholm , principal photography took place in Luleå (in the north of Sweden) to ensure enough snow and cold weather. The area where the filming took place dated from around the same time as Blackeberg, and has similar architecture.  
 The jungle gym where much of the interaction between Oskar and Eli takes place was constructed specifically for the film.  
 Most of the filming used a single, fixed, Arri 535B camera, with almost no handheld usage, and few cuts. Tracking shots relied on a track-mounted dolly , rather than Steadicam , to create calm, predictable camera movement.  
 Post-production  
 The film contains around 50 shots with computer-generated imagery . Alfredson wanted to make them very subtle and almost unnoticeable.  
 The film features analogue sound-effects exclusively throughout.  
 The sound crew won a Guldbagge Award for Best Achievement from the Swedish Film Institute , for the "nightmarishly great sound" in the film.  
 Soundtrack  
 Swedish composer Johan Söderqvist wrote the score. Alfredson instructed him to write something that sounded hopeful and romantic, in contrast to the events that take place in the film.  
 The Slovak National Symphony Orchestra performed the score; two years earlier they had performed the score for the first Swedish vampire movie, Frostbiten .  
 The song "Kvar i min bil", written and performed by Per Gessle , resonates repeatedly through the film. Originally an outtake from Gessle's solo album En händig man , the song was specially provided for the film, to resemble the sound of popular 1980s pop group Gyllene Tider .  and "Dags å välja sida" by Peps Blodsband . 
 On November 11, 2008, MovieScore Media released the film soundtrack in a limited edition of 500 copies.  It contains 21 of Söderqvist's original scores from the film. 
 Release  
 Let the Right One In received its first performance at the Gothenburg Film Festival in Sweden on 26 January 2008  
 Critical reception  
 Swedish critics generally expressed positive reactions to the film. In 26 reviews listed at the Swedish-language review site Kritiker.se it achieved an average rating of 4.0 out of 5.  
 Let the Right One In was well received by US critics. As of 2010  
 Bloody Disgusting ranked the film first in their list of the 'Top 20 Horror Films of the Decade', with the article saying "It’s rare enough for a horror film to be good; even rarer are those that function as genuine works of art. Let the Right One In is one of those films – an austerely beautiful creation that reveals itself slowly, like the best works of art do. The simplicity of the story allows Swedish director Tomas Alfredson to focus on these two pre-teen characters with a penetrating insight that not only makes it a great vampire film but a great coming-of-age film as well. At its core, the film is, simply, a human story, a pensive meditation on the transcendent possibilities of human connection. Most of all, it’s a film that sticks with you, and whose stature will continue to grow in the decades to come."  
 The film was ranked #15 in Empire magazine ' s 2010 list of "The 100 Best Films Of World Cinema". In their rationale, the authors noted that, "in these days where every second movie seems to feature vampires, it takes a very special twist on the legend to surprise us – but this one knocked us out and then bit us in the jugular", and found that the "strange central friendship" between the two lead characters was what made the film "so frightening, and so magnetic".  
 Home media  
 The film was released in North America on DVD and Blu-ray in March 2009 by Magnet Films , and in the UK in August by Momentum Pictures . The American discs feature both the original Swedish dialogue and an English dubbed version, while the European versions feature only the Swedish, and an audio-descriptive track in English. Icons of Fright reported that the American release had been criticized for using new, oversimplified English subtitles instead of the original theatrical subtitles.  The UK release retains the theatrical subtitles. 
 Awards and nominations  
 Alfredson won the Gothenburg Film Festival 's Nordic Film Prize as director of Let the Right One In on the grounds that he "succeeds to transform a vampire movie to a truly original, touching, amusing and heart-warming story about friendship and marginalisation".  
 Despite being an internationally successful film, Let the Right One In was not submitted by Sweden for the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film . The details surrounding the film's eligibility for the award resulted in some confusion.
