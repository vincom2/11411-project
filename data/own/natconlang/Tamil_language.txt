 Classification  
 Main article: Dravidian languages 
 Tamil belongs to the southern branch of the Dravidian languages , a family of around 26 languages native to the Indian subcontinent .  such as the Irula and Yerukula languages (see SIL Ethnologue ). 
 The closest major relative of Tamil is Malayalam . Until about the 19th century, Malayalam was a dialect of Tamil.  Indian Government officially announced Tamil is the oldest language in India and Tamil Nadu Government has celebrated this event at Coimbatore as World Classical Tamil Conference 2010 
 History

 As a Dravidian language, Tamil descends from Proto-Dravidian . Linguistic reconstruction suggests that Proto-Dravidian was spoken around the third millennium BC, possibly in the region around the lower Godavari river basin in peninsular India. The material evidence suggests that the speakers of Proto-Dravidian were the culture associated with the Neolithic complexes of South India .  
 Etymology  
 The exact period when the name "Tamil" came to be applied to the language is unclear, as is the precise etymology of the name. The earliest attested use of the name is found in Tholkappiyam , which is dated as early as 1st century BC.  
 The Tamil Lexicon of University of Madras defines the word 'Tamil' as 'sweetness'.  
 Old Tamil  
 The earliest records in Old Tamil are short inscriptions from around the 2nd century BC in caves and on pottery. These inscriptions are written in a variant of the Brahmi script called Tamil Brahmi .  
 Old Tamil preserved many features of Proto-Dravidian, including the inventory of consonants,  
 Despite the significant amount of grammatical and syntactical change between Old, Middle and Modern Tamil, Tamil demonstrates grammatical continuity across these stages: many characteristics of the later stages of the language have their roots in features of Old Tamil.  
 Mahadevan has brought to light in this work the influence of Old Kannada on Tamil-Br-ahm-i inscriptions from a period (Second Century B.C. to Fourth Century A.D.) anterior to the earliest Kannada inscriptions and literature. This is a very interesting observation he has made on the basis of lexical and grammatical usages showing the influence of Old Kannada.  
 Middle Tamil  
 The evolution of Old Tamil into Middle Tamil, which is generally taken to have been completed by the 8th century,  
 Middle Tamil also saw a significant increase in the Sanskritisation of Tamil. From the period of the Pallava dynasty onwards, a number of Sanskrit loan-words entered Tamil, particularly in relation to political, religious and philosophical concepts.  
 Middle Tamil is attested in a large number of inscriptions, and in a significant body of secular and religious literature.  
 Modern Tamil  
 The Nannul remains the standard normative grammar for modern literary Tamil, which therefore continues to be based on Middle Tamil of the 13th century rather than on Modern Tamil.  
 Contact with European languages also affected both written and spoken Tamil. Changes in written Tamil include the use of European-style punctuation and the use of consonant clusters that were not permitted in Middle Tamil. The syntax of written Tamil has also changed, with the introduction of new aspectual auxiliaries and more complex sentence structures, and with the emergence of a more rigid word order that resembles the syntactic argument structure of English.  
 Geographic distribution  
 
 
 
  
Distribution of Tamil speakers in South India and Sri Lanka (1961). 
 
 
 Tamil is the first language of the majority of the people residing in Tamil Nadu in India and Northern Province , Eastern Province , Sri Lanka. The language is also spoken among small minority groups in other states of India which include Karnataka , Andhra Pradesh , Kerala , Maharashtra and in certain regions of Sri Lanka such as Colombo and the hill country . Previously Tamil had a wider distribution in India than its current state. Tamil or dialects of it were used widely in the state of Kerala as the major language of administration, literature and common usage until the 12th century AD. Tamil was also used widely in inscriptions found in southern Andhra Pradesh districts of Chittoor and Nellore until the 12th century AD.  
 There are currently sizeable Tamil-speaking populations descended from colonial-era migrants in Malaysia , Singapore , Philippines , Mauritius , South Africa , Indonesia,  It is also used by groups of migrants from Sri Lanka and India, Canada (especially Toronto ), United States (especially New Jersey and New York City ), Australia , many Middle Eastern countries, and some Western European countries. 
 Legal status  
 See also: States of India by Tamil speakers 
 Tamil is the official language of the Indian state of Tamil Nadu and one of the 22 languages under schedule 8 of the constitution of India . It is also one of the official languages of the union territory of Puducherry .  
 In addition, with the creation in October 2004 of a legal status for classical languages by the Government of India and following a political campaign supported by several Tamil associations,  
 Dialects  
 Region-specific variations  
 The socio-linguistic situation of Tamil is characterised by diglossia : there are two separate registers varying by social status, a high register and a low one.  The various Tamil dialects include Bangalore Tamil , Central Tamil dialect , Kongu Tamil , Madras Bashai , Madurai Tamil , Nellai Tamil in India and Batticaloa Tamil dialect , Jaffna Tamil dialect , Negombo Tamil dialect in Sri Lanka. Sankethi dialect in Karnataka has been heavily influenced by Kannada . 
 Loanword variations  
 See also: Indo-Aryan loanwords in Tamil &#160;and Loan words in Sri Lankan Tamil 
 The dialect of the district of Palakkad in Kerala has a large number of Malayalam loanwords, has been influenced by Malayalam's syntax and also has a distinctive Malayalam accent. Similarly, Tamil spoken in Kanyakumari District has more unique words and phonetic style than Tamil spoken at other parts of Tamil Nadu. The words and phonetics are so different that a person from Kanyakumari district is easily identifiable by their spoken Tamil. Hebbar and Mandyam dialects, spoken by groups of Tamil Vaishnavites who migrated to Karnataka in the 11th century, retain many features of the Vaishnava paribasai , a special form of Tamil developed in the 9th and 10th centuries that reflect Vaishnavite religious and spiritual values.  Tamil in Sri Lanka incorporates loan words from Portuguese, Dutch , and English. 
 Spoken and literary variants  
 In addition to its various dialects, Tamil exhibits different forms: a classical literary style modelled on the ancient language ( sankattamiḻ ), a modern literary and formal style ( centamiḻ ), and a modern colloquial form ( koṭuntamiḻ ). These styles shade into each other, forming a stylistic continuum. For example, it is possible to write centamiḻ with a vocabulary drawn from caṅkattamiḻ , or to use forms associated with one of the other variants while speaking koṭuntamiḻ .  
 In modern times, centamiḻ is generally used in formal writing and speech. For instance, it is the language of textbooks, of much of Tamil literature and of public speaking and debate. In recent times, however, koṭuntamiḻ has been making inroads into areas that have traditionally been considered the province of centamiḻ . Most contemporary cinema, theatre and popular entertainment on television and radio, for example, is in koṭuntamiḻ , and many politicians use it to bring themselves closer to their audience. The increasing use of koṭuntamiḻ in modern times has led to the emergence of unofficial ‘standard' spoken dialects. In India, the ‘standard' koṭuntamiḻ , rather than on any one dialect,  but has been significantly influenced by the dialects of Thanjavur and Madurai . In Sri Lanka, the standard is based on the dialect of Jaffna . 
 Writing system

 Jambai Tamil Brahmi inscription dated to the early Sangam age 
 
 
 After Tamil Brahmi fell out of use, Tamil was written using a script called the vaṭṭeḻuttu amongst others such as Grantha and Pallava script . The current Tamil script consists of 12 vowels , 18 consonants and one special character, the āytam . The vowels and consonants combine to form 216 compound characters, giving a total of 247 characters (12 + 18 + 1 + (12 x 18)). All consonants have an inherent vowel a , as with other Indic scripts . This inherency is removed by adding a title called a puḷḷi , to the consonantal sign. For example, ன is ṉa (with the inherent a ) and ன் is ṉ (without a vowel). Many Indic scripts have a similar sign, generically called virama , but the Tamil script is somewhat different in that it nearly always uses a visible puḷḷi to indicate a dead consonant (a consonant without a vowel). In other Indic scripts, it is generally preferred to use a ligature or a half form to write a syllable or a cluster containing a dead consonant, although writing it with a visible virama is also possible. The Tamil script does not differentiate voiced and unvoiced plosives . Instead, plosives are articulated with voice depending on their position in a word, in accordance with the rules of Tamil phonology . 
 In addition to the standard characters, six characters taken from the Grantha script , which was used in the Tamil region to write Sanskrit, are sometimes used to represent sounds not native to Tamil, that is, words adopted from Sanskrit, Prakrit and other languages. The traditional system prescribed by classical grammars for writing loan-words, which involves respelling them in accordance with Tamil phonology, remains, but is not always consistently applied.  
 Phonology  
 Main article: Tamil phonology 
 Tamil phonology is characterised by the presence of retroflex consonants and multiple rhotics . Tamil does not distinguish phonologically between voiced and unvoiced consonants; phonetically, voice is assigned depending on a consonant's position in a word.  Tamil phonology permits few consonant clusters, which can never be word initial. Native grammarians classify Tamil phonemes into vowels, consonants, and a "secondary character", the āytam. 
 Vowels  
 Tamil vowels are called uyireḻuttu ( uyir – life, eḻuttu &#160;– letter). The vowels are classified into short ( kuṟil ) and long ( neṭil ) (with five of each type) and two diphthongs , /ai/ and /au/, and three "shortened" ( kuṟṟil ) vowels. 
 The long vowels are about twice as long as the short vowels. The diphthongs are usually pronounced about 1.5 times as long as the short vowels, though most grammatical texts place them with the long vowels.

 Consonants  
 Tamil consonants are known as meyyeḻuttu ( mey —body, eḻuttu —letters). The consonants are classified into three categories with six in each category: valliṉam —hard, melliṉam —soft or Nasal , and iṭayiṉam —medium. 
 Unlike most Indian languages, Tamil does not distinguish aspirated and unaspirated consonants. In addition, the voicing of plosives is governed by strict rules in centamiḻ . Plosives are unvoiced if they occur word-initially or doubled. Elsewhere they are voiced, with a few becoming fricatives intervocalically . Nasals and approximants are always voiced.  
 Tamil is characterised by its use of more than one type of coronal consonants : like many of the other languages of India, it contains a series of retroflex consonants . Notably, the Tamil retroflex series includes the retroflex approximant /ɻ/ (ழ) (example Tami l ; often transcribed 'zh'), which is absent in the Indo-Aryan languages. Among the other Dravidian languages, the retroflex approximant also occurs in Malayalam (for example in 'Ko zh ikode'), disappeared from spoken Kannada around 1000 AD (although the character is still written, and exists in Unicode ), and was never present in Telugu . In many dialects of colloquial Tamil, this consonant is seen as disappearing and shifting to the alveolar lateral approximant /l/

 Sounds in brackets are voiced allophones. They are written the same as the voiceless allophones, as voicing is determined by context. The sounds /f/ and /ʂ/ are peripheral to the phonology of Tamil, being found only in loanwords and frequently replaced by native sounds. There are well-defined rules for elision in Tamil categorised into classes based on the phoneme which undergoes elision. 
 Āytam  
 Classical Tamil also had a phoneme called the Āytam , written as ‘ஃ'. Tamil grammarians of the time classified it as a dependent phoneme (or restricted phoneme  ) when writing English words using the Tamil script. 
 Numerals and symbols  
 Main article: Tamil numerals 
 Apart from the usual numerals, Tamil also has numerals for 10, 100 and 1000. Symbols for day, month, year, debit, credit, as above, rupee, and numeral are present as well.Tamil also uses several historical fractional signs.

 Grammar  
 Main article: Tamil grammar 
 Tamil employs agglutinative grammar, where suffixes are used to mark noun class , number , and case , verb tense and other grammatical categories. Tamil's standard metalinguistic terminology and scholarly vocabulary is itself Tamil, as opposed to the Sanskrit that is standard for most other Dravidian languages .  
 Much of Tamil grammar is extensively described in the oldest known grammar book for Tamil, the Tolkāppiyam . Modern Tamil writing is largely based on the 13th century grammar Naṉṉūl which restated and clarified the rules of the Tolkāppiyam , with some modifications. Traditional Tamil grammar consists of five parts, namely eḻuttu , col , poruḷ , yāppu , aṇi . Of these, the last two are mostly applied in poetry.  
 Tamil words consist of a lexical root to which one or more affixes are attached. Most Tamil affixes are suffixes . Tamil suffixes can be derivational suffixes , which either change the part of speech of the word or its meaning, or inflectional suffixes , which mark categories such as person , number , mood , tense , etc. There is no absolute limit on the length and extent of agglutination , which can lead to long words with a large number of suffixes. 
 Morphology  
 Tamil nouns (and pronouns) are classified into two super-classes ( tiṇai )—the "rational" ( uyartiṇai ), and the "irrational" ( akṟiṇai )—which include a total of five classes ( pāl , which literally means ‘gender'). Humans and deities are classified as "rational", and all other nouns (animals, objects, abstract nouns) are classified as irrational. The "rational" nouns and pronouns belong to one of three classes ( pāl )—masculine singular, feminine singular, and rational plural. The "irrational" nouns and pronouns belong to one of two classes: irrational singular and irrational plural. The pāl is often indicated through suffixes. The plural form for rational nouns may be used as an honorific , gender-neutral, singular form.  
 Suffixes are used to perform the functions of cases or postpositions . Traditional grammarians tried to group the various suffixes into eight cases corresponding to the cases used in Sanskrit . These were the nominative , accusative , dative , sociative , genitive , instrumental , locative , and ablative . Modern grammarians argue that this classification is artificial,  Tamil nouns can take one of four prefixes , i , a , u , and e which are functionally equivalent to the demonstratives in English. 
 Tamil verbs are also inflected through the use of suffixes. A typical Tamil verb form will have a number of suffixes , which show person, number, mood, tense, and voice. 
 
 Person and number are indicated by suffixing the oblique case of the relevant pronoun. The suffixes to indicate tenses and voice are formed from grammatical particles , which are added to the stem. 
 Tamil has two voices. The first indicates that the subject of the sentence undergoes or is the object of the action named by the verb stem, and the second indicates that the subject of the sentence directs the action referred to by the verb stem. 
 Tamil has three simple tenses—past, present, and future—indicated by the suffixes, as well as a series of perfects indicated by compound suffixes. Mood is implicit in Tamil, and is normally reflected by the same morphemes which mark tense categories. Tamil verbs also mark evidentiality , through the addition of the hearsay clitic ām .  
 
 Traditional grammars of Tamil do not distinguish between adjectives and adverbs , including both of them under the category uriccol , although modern grammarians tend to distinguish between them on morphological and syntactical grounds.  
 Tamil does not have articles . Definiteness and indefiniteness are either indicated by special grammatical devices, such as using the number "one" as an indefinite article, or by the context.  
 Syntax  
 Tamil is a consistently head-final language. The verb comes at the end of the clause, with a typical word order of subject–object–verb (SOV).  However, word order in Tamil is also flexible, so that surface permutations of the SOV order are possible with different pragmatic effects. Tamil has postpositions rather than prepositions . Demonstratives and modifiers precede the noun within the noun phrase. Subordinate clauses precede the verb of the matrix clause. 
 Tamil is a null-subject language . Not all Tamil sentences have subjects, verbs, and objects. It is possible to construct grammatically valid and meaningful sentences which lack one or more of the three. For example, a sentence may only have a verb—such as muṭintuviṭṭatu ("completed")—or only a subject and object, without a verb such as atu eṉ vīṭu ("That  my house"). Tamil does not have a copula (a linking verb equivalent to the word is ). The word is included in the translations only to convey the meaning more easily. 
 Vocabulary  
 See also: Wiktionary:Category:Tamil language 
 The vocabulary of Tamil is mainly Dravidian. A strong sense of linguistic purism is found in Modern Tamil,  
 The strongest impact of purism in Tamil has been on words taken from Sanskrit. During its history, Tamil, along with other Dravidian languages like Telugu , Kannada , Malayalam etc., was influenced by Sanskrit in terms of vocabulary, grammar and literary styles,  
 In the 20th century, institutions and learned bodies have, with government support, generated technical dictionaries for Tamil containing neologisms and words derived from Tamil roots to replace loan words from English and other languages.

 Main article: Words of Tamil origin 
 Words of Tamil origin occur in other languages. A notable example of a word in worldwide use with Dravidian (not specifically Tamil) etymology is orange , via Sanskrit nāraṅga from a Dravidian predecessor of Tamil nartankāy "fragrant fruit". Popular examples in English are cheroot ( churuṭṭu meaning "rolled up"),

The dating of Sangam literature and the identification of its language with Old Tamil have recently been questioned by Herman Tieken who argues that the works are better understood as 9th century Pāṇṭiyan dynasty compositions, deliberately written in an archaising style to make them seem older than they were ( Tieken 2001 ). Tieken's dating has, however, been criticised by reviewers of his work. See e.g. Hart 2004 , Ferro-Luzzi 2001 , Monius 2002 and Wilden 2003

It was not until the DMK came to power in 1967 that such demands were fulfilled, and the pure Tamil cause received a boost, although purification efforts are not particularly high on the agenda of either the Dravidian movement or the Dravidianist idiom of tamiḻppaṟṟu."
