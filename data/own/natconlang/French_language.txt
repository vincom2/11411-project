 French ( le français   
 French is an Italic language descended from the spoken Latin language of the Roman Empire , as are languages such as Italian , Portuguese , Spanish , Romanian , Lombard , Catalan , Sicilian and Sardinian . Its closest relatives are the other langues d'oïl —languages historically spoken in northern France and in Belgium, which French has largely supplanted. French was also influenced by native Celtic languages of Roman Gaul and by the ( Germanic ) Frankish language of the post-Roman Frankish invaders. Today, owing to France's past overseas expansion, there are numerous French-based creole languages , most notably Haitian . 
 French is an official language in 29 countries , most of which form la francophonie (in French), the community of French-speaking countries. It is an official language of all United Nations agencies and a large number of international organizations . According to France's Ministry of Foreign and European Affairs , 77 million in Europe speak French natively. Outside of France, the highest numbers of French speakers are found in Canada (25% of the population, of whom most live in Quebec), Belgium (45% of the population), Switzerland (20% of the population) and Luxembourg. In 2013, the Ministry identified French as the second most spoken language in Europe, after German and before English .  As a result of extensive colonial ambitions of France and Belgium (at that time governed by a French-speaking elite), between the 17th and 20th centuries, French was introduced to colonies in the Americas, Africa, Polynesia, the Levant, Southeast Asia, and the Caribbean. 
 According to a demographic projection led by the Université Laval and the Réseau Démographie de l'Agence universitaire de la francophonie , French speakers will number approximately 500 million people in 2025 and 650 million people, or approximately 7% of the world's population by 2050.

 In Belgium , French is the official language of Wallonia (excluding a part of the East Cantons , which are German-speaking ) and one of the two official languages—along with Dutch —of the Brussels-Capital Region , where it is spoken by the majority of the population, though often not as their primary language.  
 Switzerland  
 Further information: Languages of Switzerland ,&#160; Swiss French ,&#160;and&#160; Romandie 
 French is one of the four official languages of Switzerland (along with German , Italian and Romansh ) and is spoken in the western part of Switzerland called Romandie , of which Geneva is the largest city. The language divisions in Switzerland do not coincide with political subdivisions and some cantons have bilingual status for example, cities such Biel/Bienne or cantons such as Valais-Fribourg-Berne. French is the native language of about 20% of the Swiss population and is spoken by 50.4%  of the population. 
 Most of Swiss French is mutually compatible with the standard French spoken in France, but it is often used with small differences, such as those involving numbers after 69 and slight differences in other vocabulary terms. 
 Monaco and Andorra

 Although Monégasque is the national language of the Principality of Monaco , French is the only official language, and French nationals make up some 47% of the population. 
 Catalan is the only official language of Andorra ; however, French is commonly used because of the proximity to France and the fact that the French President is, with the bishop of Urgell, Spain, a co-prince of the territory. French nationals make up 7% of the population.

 French is one of three official languages of the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg , alongside German and Luxembourgish , the natively spoken language of Luxembourg. French is primarily used for administrative purposes by the government, and is also the primary language used to converse with foreigners. Luxembourg's education system is trilingual: the first cycle of basic school is in Luxembourgish, before changing officially to German for most branches; while in secondary school, the language of instruction changes to French for most subjects, such as mathematics and science.

 French is a large minority language and immigrant language in the United Kingdom . Over 300,000 French people live in the UK, and the language is also spoken by a large number of the African immigrants in the UK. French is also the most popular foreign language studied in UK schools. According to a 2006 European Commission report, 23% of UK residents are able to carry on a conversation in French.  
 Modern and Middle English reflect a mixture of Oïl and Old English lexicons after the Norman Conquest of England in 1066, when a Norman-speaking aristocracy took control of a population whose mother tongue was Germanic in origin. Due to the intertwined histories of England and continental possessions of the English Crown, many formal and legal words from Modern English have French roots. Therefore words such as buy and sell are of Germanic origin, purchase and vend are from Old French . 
 French is an official language in both Jersey and Guernsey . Both use French to some degree, mostly in an administrative or ceremonial capacity. Jersey Legal French is the standardized variety used in Jersey. However, Norman (in its local forms, Guernésiais and Jèrriais ) is the historical vernacular of the islands.

 French is the second most common language in Canada , after English , and both are official languages at the federal level. French is the sole official language in the province of Quebec , being the mother tongue for some 7 million people, or almost 80.1% (2006 Census) of the province. About 95.0% of the people of Quebec speak French as either their first or second language, and for some as their third language. Quebec is also home to the city of Montreal , which is the world's fourth largest French speaking city, by number of first language speakers.  Furthermore, while French is not an official language in Ontario , the French Language Services Act ensures that provincial services are to be available in the language. The Act applies to areas of the province where there are significant Francophone communities, namely Eastern Ontario and Northern Ontario . Elsewhere, sizable French-speaking minorities are found in southern Manitoba, Nova Scotia , and the Port au Port Peninsula in Newfoundland and Labrador , where the unique Newfoundland French dialect was historically spoken. Smaller pockets of French speakers exist in all other provinces. 
 About 9,487,500 of Canadians speak French as their first language, or around 30% of the country,  
 The difference between French spoken in Quebec and French spoken in France is similar in degree to that between American and British English. In Quebec , where the majority of French-speaking Canadians live, the Office québécois de la langue française (English: Quebec Board of the French language) regulates Quebec French and ensures the Charter of the French Language (Bill 101 &amp; 104) is respected. 
 Haiti  
 French is one of Haiti's two official languages. It is the principal language of writing, school instruction, and administrative use. It is spoken by all educated Haitians and is used in the business sector. It is also used in ceremonial events such as weddings, graduations and church masses. About 10–15% of the country's population have French as their first language; the rest speak it as a secondary language in varying degrees of proficiency from basic level to fluent. The second official language is the recently standardized Haitian Creole , which virtually the entire population of Haiti speaks. Haitian Creole is one of the French-based creole languages , drawing the large majority of its vocabulary from French, with influences from West African languages, as well as several European languages. Haitian Creole is closely related to Louisiana Creole and other French creoles.

 According to the U.S. Census Bureau (2011), French is the fourth  most-spoken language in the United States after English , Spanish , and Chinese , when all forms of French are considered together and all dialects of Chinese are similarly combined. French remains the second most-spoken language in the states of Louisiana , Maine , Vermont and New Hampshire . 
 Louisiana is home to many distinct dialects, collectively known as Louisiana French . Cajun French has the largest number of speakers, mostly living in Acadiana . According to the 2000 United States Census, there are over 194,000 people in Louisiana who speak French at home, the most of any state if Creole French is excluded.  
 Brazil  
 The Portuguese language is heavily influenced by more than a millennium of perennial contact with several dialects of both Oïl (chiefly French after France became the major European power) and Occitan (chiefly Provençal around the troubadour apex in the Middle Ages, see Galician-Portuguese lyric ), in lexicon (up to 15–20% in some estimates, at least 5000 word roots), phonology (chiefly among the European and more Europeanized Brazilian dialects) and orthography.  
 The French language was also briefly spoken in Brazil during the colonial attempts of France Antarctique and France équinoxiale at the 16th and 17th centuries respectively (the expulsing of early French colonists by the Portuguese culminated on the founding of the cities of Rio de Janeiro and São Luís respectively). Also, as mentioned above, the language was used by several communities of immigrants and expatriates in the 18th, 19th and 20th centuries, chiefly Swiss, but also some French and Belgians , and the anti-Portuguese factor of Brazilian nationalism in the 19th century led to an increased use of the French language in detriment of Portuguese, as France was seen at the time as a model of civilization and progress.  
 Today the Karipuna indigenous community (nearly 30,000 people) of Amapá in Northern Brazil speaks a French creole, the Lanc-Patuá creole , possibly related to the French Guiana Creole .

 Main articles: African French and Maghreb French 
 A majority of the world's French-speaking population lives in Africa. According to the 2007 report by the Organisation internationale de la Francophonie, an estimated 115 million African people spread across 31 Francophone countries can speak French as either a first or a second language .  
 French is mostly a second language in Africa, but it has become a first language in some urban areas, such as the region of Abidjan , Côte d'Ivoire  In fact, the term African French is a misnomer, as forms are different from country to country, and the root of the French spoken in a particular country depends on its former colonial empire. French spoken in Benin, for example, is closer to that spoken in France than to French spoken in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, which is chiefly derived from Belgian French . 
 In the territories of the Indian Ocean , the French language is often spoken alongside French-derived creole languages, the major exception being Madagascar . There, a Malayo-Polynesian language ( Malagasy ) is spoken alongside French. 
 Sub-Saharan Africa is the region where the French language is most likely to expand, because of the expansion of education and rapid population growth.  but written forms of the language are very closely related to those of the rest of the French-speaking world. 
 French is an official language in the following African countries, most of them former French or Belgian colonies : 
 
 
 &#160; Benin 
 &#160; Burkina Faso 
 &#160; Burundi 
 &#160; Cameroon 
 &#160; Central African Republic

 In addition, French is an administrative language and widely used, though not on an official basis, in Mauritius , where approximately 78% of the population speak French. French is also spoken in the Maghreb states: 
 
 &#160; Algeria (see also languages of Algeria ) 
 &#160; Mauritania (see also languages of Mauritania ) 
 &#160; Morocco (see also languages of Morocco ) 
 &#160; Tunisia (see also languages of Tunisia )

 Most urban Algerians have some working knowledge of French, and a high (though unknown) percentage speak it fluently (as much as around 70-80%). However, because of the country's colonial past, the predominance of French has long been politically problematic. 
 Numerous reforms have been implemented in recent decades to improve the status of both Arabic and, in recent years to a much minor degree, Tamazight in relation to French, especially in education. For this reason, although Algeria is certainly one of the most Francophone of countries in the world outside of France, and has perhaps the second largest number of French speakers,  it does not participate in the Francophonie association.

Many Egyptians learn English and French in addition to Arabic. Private schools have either English or French as the main language of instruction. Egypt participates in the Francophonie . There are two French-speaking universities in the country, the Université Française d'Égypte and the Université Senghor .

 French was the official language of the colony of French Indochina , comprising modern-day Vietnam , Laos , and Cambodia . It continues to be an administrative language in Laos and Cambodia, although its influence has waned in recent years.  Since the Fall of Saigon and the opening of a unified Vietnam's economy, French has gradually been effectively displaced as the main foreign language of choice by English. French nevertheless maintains its colonial legacy by being spoken as a second language by the elderly and elite populations and is presently being revived in higher education and continues to be a diplomatic language in Vietnam.

 A former French colony, Lebanon designates Arabic as the sole official language, while a special law regulates cases when French can be publicly used. French is widely used as a second language by the Lebanese, and is taught in many schools as a secondary language along with Arabic and English. The language is also used on bank notes, on road signs, and on official buildings (alongside Arabic). Similarly, Syria was also a French colony until 1943, but the French language is largely extinct in the country and is only limited to some members of the elite and middle classes. A significant French-speaking community is also present in Israel , primarily among the community of Maghrebi Jews , and many secondary schools offer French as a foreign language. 
 India  
 French has de jure official status in the Indian union territory of Puducherry (formerly Pondicherry) along with the regional languages of Tamil , Telugu , and Malayalam . However at the district level, French is only official in the districts of Pondicherry and Mahé , while the other two districts of the territory designate local languages as official. Furthermore, according to the French Institute of Pondicherry , French is " very little spoken " in Puducherry, with only about 1% of the territory's population being able to speak the language.

 History  
 Main article: History of French 
 French is a Romance language (meaning that it is descended primarily from Vulgar Latin ) that evolved out of the Gallo-Romance dialects spoken in northern France. 
 French was the most important language of diplomacy and international relations from the 17th century to approximately the middle of the 20th century. English has now taken over that role, since following the Second World War , the US became the dominant global power.  
 French remains one of the most important diplomatic languages,

 Although there are many French regional accents, foreign learners normally study only one version of the language, which has no commonly used special name. 
 
 There are a maximum of 17 vowels in French, not all of which are used in every dialect: /a/, /ɑ/, /e/, /ɛ/, /ɛː/, /ə/, /i/, /o/, /ɔ/, /y/, /u/, /œ/, /ø/, plus the nasalized vowels /ɑ̃/, /ɛ̃/, /ɔ̃/ and /œ̃/ . In France, the vowels /ɑ/ and /œ̃/ are tending to be replaced by /a/ and /ɛ̃/ in many people's speech. /ɛː/ only appears in Canadian dialects. 
 Voiced stops (i.e., /b d ɡ/ ) are typically produced fully voiced throughout. 
 Voiceless stops (i.e., /p t k/ ) are unaspirated. 
 Nasals: The velar nasal /ŋ/ can occur in final position in borrowed (usually English) words: parking, camping, swing . The palatal nasal /ɲ/ can occur in word initial position (e.g., gnon ), but it is most frequently found in intervocalic, onset position or word-finally (e.g., montagne ). 
 Fricatives: French has three pairs of homorganic fricatives distinguished by voicing, i.e., labiodental /f/~/v/ , dental /s/~/z/ , and palato-alveolar /ʃ/~/ʒ/ . Notice that /s/~/z/ are dental, like the plosives /t/~/d/ and the nasal /n/ . 
 French has one rhotic whose pronunciation varies considerably among speakers and phonetic contexts. In general, it is described as a voiced uvular fricative , as in  occurs in some dialects. 
 Lateral and central approximants: The lateral approximant /l/ is unvelarised in both onset ( lire ) and coda position ( il ). In the onset, the central approximants  each correspond to a high vowel, /u/ , /y/ , and /i/ respectively. There are a few minimal pairs where the approximant and corresponding vowel contrast, but there are also many cases where they are in free variation. Contrasts between /j/ and /i/ occur in final position as in /pɛj/ paye , "pay", vs. /pɛi/ pays , "country". 
 
 French pronunciation follows strict rules based on spelling, but French spelling is often based more on history than phonology. The rules for pronunciation vary between dialects, but the standard rules are: 
 
 final consonants: Final single consonants, in particular s , x , z , t , d , n , g and m , are normally silent. (A consonant is considered "final" when no vowel follows it even if one or more consonants follow it.) The final letters c , f , k , q , and l , however, are normally pronounced. The final r is usually silent when it follows an e in a word of two or more syllables, but is pronounced in other cases. The t is pronounced when it follows a c .
 
 When the following word begins with a vowel, however, a silent consonant may once again be pronounced, to provide a liaison or "link" between the two words. Some liaisons are mandatory , for example the s in les amants or vous avez ; some are optional , depending on dialect and register , for example, the first s in deux cents euros or euros irlandais ; and some are forbidden , for example, the s in beaucoup d'hommes aiment . The t of et is never pronounced and the silent final consonant of a noun is only pronounced in the plural and in set phrases like pied-à-terre . 
 Doubling a final n and adding a silent e at the end of a word (e.g., chien → chienne ) makes it clearly pronounced. Doubling a final l and adding a silent e (e.g., gentil → gentille ) adds a  sound if the l is preceded by the letter i . 
 
 
 elision or vowel dropping: Some monosyllabic function words ending in a or e , such as je and que , drop their final vowel when placed before a word that begins with a vowel sound (thus avoiding a hiatus ). The missing vowel is replaced by an apostrophe. (e.g., je ai is instead pronounced and spelled → j'ai ). This gives, for example, the same pronunciation for l'homme qu'il a vu ("the man whom he saw") and l'homme qui l'a vu ("the man who saw him"). However, for Belgian French the sentences are pronounced differently; in the first sentence the syllable break is as "qu'il-a", while the second breaks as "qui-l'a". It can also be noted that, in Quebec French , the second example ( l'homme qui l'a vu ) is more emphasized on l'a vu .

 French is written with the 26 letters of the basic Latin script , with four diacritics appearing on vowels ( circumflex accent, acute accent , grave accent , diaeresis ) and the cedilla appearing in "ç". 
 There are two ligatures , "œ" and "æ". 
 Orthography  
 Main article: French orthography 
 French spelling, like English spelling, tends to preserve obsolete pronunciation rules. This is mainly due to extreme phonetic changes since the Old French period, without a corresponding change in spelling (see Vocabulary below). Moreover, some conscious changes were made to restore Latin orthography: 
 
 Old French doit &gt; French doigt "finger" (Latin digitus ) 
 Old French pie &gt; French pied "foot"  
 
 As a result, it can be difficult to predict the spelling of a word based on the sound. Final consonants are generally silent, except when the following word begins with a vowel (see Liaison (French) ). For example, the following words end in a vowel sound: pied , aller , les , finit , beaux . The same words followed by a vowel, however, may sound the consonants, as they do in these examples: beaux-arts , les amis , pied-à-terre . 
 On the other hand, a given spelling usually leads to a predictable sound. In particular, a given vowel combination or diacritic predictably leads to one phoneme. 
 French writing, as with any language, is affected by the spoken language. In Old French, the plural for animal was animals . The /als/ sequence was unstable and was turned into a diphthong /aus/ . This change was then reflected in the orthography: animaus . The us ending, very common in Latin, was then abbreviated by copyists (monks) by the letter x , resulting in a written form animax . As the French language further evolved, the pronunciation of au turned into /o/ so that the u was reestablished in orthography for consistency, resulting in modern French animaux (pronounced first /animos/ before the final /s/ was dropped in contemporary French). The same is true for cheval pluralized as chevaux and many others. In addition, castel pl. castels became château pl. châteaux 
 
 Nasal : n and m . When n or m follows a vowel or diphthong, the n or m becomes silent and causes the preceding vowel to become nasalized (i.e., pronounced with the soft palate extended downward so as to allow part of the air to leave through the nostrils). Exceptions are when the n or m is doubled, or immediately followed by a vowel. The prefixes en- and em- are always nasalized. The rules are more complex than this but may vary between dialects. 
 Digraphs : French uses not only diacritics to specify its large range of vowel sounds and diphthongs , but also specific combinations of vowels, sometimes with following consonants, to show which sound is intended. 
 Gemination : Within words, double consonants are generally not pronounced as geminates in modern French (but geminates can be heard in the cinema or TV news from as recently as the 1970s, and in very refined elocution they may still occur). For example, illusion is pronounced  . 
 Accents are used sometimes for pronunciation, sometimes to distinguish similar words, and sometimes for etymology alone.
 
 Accents that affect pronunciation
 
 The acute accent ( l'accent aigu ) é (e.g., é cole —school) means that the vowel is pronounced /e/ instead of the default /ə/ . 
 The grave accent ( l'accent grave ) è (e.g., él è ve —pupil) means that the vowel is pronounced /ɛ/ instead of the default /ə/ . 
 The circumflex ( l'accent circonflexe ) ê (e.g. for ê t —forest) shows that an e is pronounced /ɛ/ and that an ô is pronounced /o/ . In standard French, it also signifies a pronunciation of /ɑ/ for the letter â , but this differentiation is disappearing. In the late 19th century, the circumflex was used in place of s after a vowel, where that letter s was not pronounced. Thus, forest became forêt and hospital became hôpital . 
 The diaeresis ( le tréma ) (e.g., na ï f —naive, No ë l —Christmas) as in English, specifies that this vowel is pronounced separately from the preceding one, not combined, and is not a schwa . 
 The cedilla ( la cédille ) ç (e.g., gar ç on —boy) means that the letter ç is pronounced /s/ in front of the back vowels a , o and u ( c is otherwise /k/ before a back vowel). C is always pronounced /s/ in front of the front vowels e , i , and y , thus ç is never found in front of front vowels. 
 
 
 Accents with no pronunciation effect
 
 The circumflex does not affect the pronunciation of the letters i or u and, in most dialects, a as well. It usually indicates that an s came after it long ago, as in île ( isle , compare with English island ). The explanation is that some words share the same orthography, so the circumflex is put here to spot the difference between the two words. For example, dites (you say) / dîtes (you said), or even du (of the) / dû (past for the verb devoir = must, have to, owe; in this case, the circumflex splits at the plural and the feminine). 
 All other accents are used only to distinguish similar words, as in the case of distinguishing the adverbs là and où ("there", "where") from the article la ("the" feminine singular) and the conjunction ou ("or"), respectively. 
 
 
 
 
 
 Some proposals exist to simplify the existing writing system, but they still fail to gather interest.  
 Grammar  
 Main article: French grammar 
 French grammar shares several notable features with most other Romance languages, including 
 
 the loss of Latin's declensions 
 only two grammatical genders 
 the development of grammatical articles from Latin demonstratives 
 new tenses formed from auxiliaries 
 
 French declarative word order is subject–verb–object although a pronoun object precedes the verb. Some types of sentences allow for or require different word orders, in particular inversion of the subject and verb like "Parlez-vous français?" when asking a question rather than just "Vous parlez français?" Both questions mean the same thing, however, a rising inflection is always used on both of them whenever asking a question, especially on the second one. Specifically, the first translates into "Do you speak French?" while the second one is literally just "You speak French?" 
 Vocabulary  
 The majority of French words derive from Vulgar Latin or were constructed from Latin or Greek roots. In many cases a single etymological root appears in French in a "popular" or native form, inherited from Vulgar Latin, and a learned form, borrowed later from Classical Latin . The following pairs consist of a native noun and a learned adjective: 
 
 brother: frère / fraternel from Latin frater / fraternalis 
 finger: doigt / digital from Latin digitus / digitalis 
 faith: foi / fidèle from Latin fides / fidelis 
 eye: œil / oculaire from Latin oculus / ocularis 
 
 However a historical tendency to gallicise Latin roots can be identified, whereas English conversely leans towards a more direct incorporation of the Latin: 
 
 presqu'île / peninsula 
 éteindre / extinguish 
 noyau / nucleus 
 surhomme / superman 
 ensoleillement / insolation 
 
 There are also noun-noun and adjective-adjective pairs: 
 
 thing/cause: chose / cause from Latin causa 
 cold: froid / frigide from Latin frigidum 
 
 It can be difficult to identify the Latin source of native French words, because in the evolution from Vulgar Latin , unstressed syllables were severely reduced and the remaining vowels and consonants underwent significant modifications. 
 More recently the linguistic policy of the French language academies of France and Quebec has been to provide French equivalents  to (mainly English) imported words, either by using existing vocabulary, extending its meaning or deriving a new word according to French morphological rules. The result is often two (or more) co-existing terms for describing the same phenomenon, with varying rates of success for the French equivalent. 
 
 mercatique / marketing 
 finance fantôme / shadow banking 
 bloc-notes / blog 
 ailière / wingsuit 
 tiers-lieu / coworking 
 
 It is estimated that 12% (4,200) of common French words found in a typical dictionary such as the Petit Larousse or Micro-Robert Plus (35,000 words) are of foreign origin (where Greek and Latin learned words are not seen as foreign). About 25% (1,054) of these foreign words come from English and are fairly recent borrowings. The others are some 707 words from Italian , 550 from ancient Germanic languages , 481 from other Gallo-Romance languages , 215 from Arabic , 164 from German , 160 from Celtic languages , 159 from Spanish , 153 from Dutch , 112 from Persian and Sanskrit , 101 from Native American languages , 89 from other Asian languages , 56 from other Afro-Asiatic languages , 55 from Slavic languages and Baltic languages , 10 from Basque and 144 (about 3%) from other languages.  
 Numerals  
 The French counting system is partially vigesimal : twenty ( vingt ) is used as a base number in the names of numbers from 60 to 99. 
 The French word for 80 is quatre-vingts , literally "four twenties", and the word for 75 is soixante-quinze , literally "sixty-fifteen". This reform arose after the French Revolution to unify the different counting systems (mostly vigesimal near the coast, because of Celtic (via Breton ) and Viking influences). 
 This system is comparable to the archaic English use of score , as in "fourscore and seven" (87), or "threescore and ten" (70). 
 In Old French (during the Middle Ages ), all numbers from 30 to 99 could be said in either base 10 or base 20, e.g. vint et doze (twenty and twelve) for 32, dous vinz et diz (two twenties and ten) for 50, uitante for 80, or nonante for 90.  
 Belgian French , Swiss French and the French used in the Democratic Republic of the Congo , Rwanda and Burundi are different in this respect. 
 In Belgium and Switzerland 70 and 90 are septante and nonante . In Switzerland, depending on the local dialect, 80 can be quatre-vingts (Geneva, Neuchâtel, Jura) or huitante (Vaud, Valais, Fribourg). Octante had been used in Switzerland in the past, but is now considered archaic.  In Belgium and in its former African colonies, however, quatre-vingts is universally used. 
 It should also be noted that French, like most European languages, uses a period (also called a full stop) or a space to separate thousands where English uses a comma or (more recently) a space. The comma is used in French numbers as a decimal point: 2,5 = deux virgule cinq . 
 Cardinal numbers in French from 1 to 20 are as follows&#160;: 
 
 One: un / une /œ̃/ (m) ~ /yn/ (f) 
 Two: deux /dø/ 
 Three: trois /tʁwɑ/ 
 Four: quatre /katʁ/ 
 Five: cinq /sɛ̃k/ 
 Six: six /sis/ 
 Seven: sept /sɛt/ 
 Eight: huit /ɥit/ 
 Nine : neuf /nœf/ 
 Ten: dix /dis/ 
 Eleven: onze /ɔ̃z/ 
 Twelve: douze /duz/ 
 Thirteen: treize /tʁɛz/ 
 Fourteen: quatorze /katɔʁz/ 
 Fifteen: quinze /kɛ̃z/ 
 Sixteen: seize /sɛz/ 
 Seventeen: dix-sept /dissɛt/ 
 Eighteen: dix-huit /diz‿ɥit/ 
 Nineteen: dix-neuf /diznœf/ 
 Twenty: vingt /vɛ̃/ 
 
 Nine and New are the same word, as this is an unusual preservation from the original Indo-European languages that at one time only terminated at 8.
