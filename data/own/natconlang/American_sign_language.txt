 American Sign Language ( ASL ) is the predominant sign language of deaf communities in the United States and English-speaking parts of Canada . Besides North America , dialects of ASL and ASL-based creoles are used in many countries around the world, including much of West Africa and parts of Southeast Asia . ASL is also widely learned as a second language , serving as a lingua franca . ASL is most closely related to French Sign Language (FSL). It has been proposed that ASL is a creole language , although ASL shows features atypical of creole languages, such as agglutinative morphology . 
 ASL originated in the early 19th century in the American School for the Deaf (ASD) in Hartford, Connecticut , from a situation of language contact . Since then, ASL use propagated widely via schools for the deaf and deaf community organizations. Despite its wide use, no accurate count of ASL users has been taken, though reliable estimates for American ASL users range from 250,000 to 500,000 persons, including a number of children of deaf adults . ASL users face stigma due to beliefs in the superiority of spoken language to signed language, compounded by the fact that ASL is often glossed in English due to the lack of a standard writing system. 
 ASL signs have a number of phonemic components, including movement of the face and torso as well as the hands. ASL is not a form of pantomime , but iconicity does play a larger role in ASL than in spoken languages. English loan words are often borrowed through fingerspelling , although ASL grammar is unrelated to that of English. ASL has verbal agreement and aspectual marking , and has a productive system of forming agglutinative classifiers . Many linguists believe ASL to be a subject-verb-object (SVO) language, but there are several alternative proposals to account for ASL word order.

 Classification  
 ASL emerged as a language in the American School for the Deaf (ASD), founded in 1817.  
 The influence of FSL on ASL is readily apparent; for example, it has been found that about 58% of signs in modern ASL are cognate to Old French Sign Language signs.  
 
 I see, however, and I say it with regret, that any efforts that we have made or may still be making, to do better than, we have inadvertently fallen somewhat back of Abbé de l’Épée. Some of us have learned and still learn signs from uneducated pupils, instead of learning them from well instructed and experienced teachers. 
 —Clerc,&#160; 1852, from Woodward 1978:336 
 
 It has been proposed that ASL is a creole with FSL as the superstrate language and with the native village sign languages as substrate languages.  
 Although the United States, the United Kingdom , and Australia share English as a common oral and written language, ASL is not mutually intelligible with British Sign Language (BSL) or Auslan .  
 History

 Prior to the birth of ASL, signed language had been used by various communities in the United States.  
 In the 19th century, a "triangle" of village sign languages was developed in New England : one in Martha's Vineyard , Massachusetts; one in Henniker, New Hampshire , and one in Sandy River Valley, Maine .  
 ASL is thought to have originated in the American School for the Deaf (ASD), founded in Hartford, Connecticut in 1817.  
 The largest group of students during the first seven decades of the school were from Martha’s Vineyard, and they brought MVSL with them.  
 
 
 
  
American Sign Language Convention of March 2008 in Austin , Texas 
 
 
 More schools for the deaf were founded after ASD, and knowledge of ASL spread to these schools.  
 Up to the 1950s, the predominant method in deaf education was oralism – acquiring oral language comprehension and production.  
 Population  
 Counting the number of ASL speakers is difficult because ASL users have never been counted by the American census.  
 Incorrect figures are sometimes cited for the population of ASL speakers in the United States based on misunderstandings of known statistics.  
 ASL is sometimes incorrectly cited as the third- or fourth-most-spoken language in the United States.  
 Geographic distribution  
 ASL is used throughout Anglo-America .  
 Throughout West Africa , ASL-based sign languages are spoken by educated deaf adults.  
 In addition to the aforementioned West African countries, ASL is reported to be used as a first language in Barbados , Bolivia , Cambodia ,  
 Variation  
 
 
 
 Variants of ABOUT in Canadian ASL 
 
 
 
 &#160; 
 
 About – General sign (Canadian ASL)  
 
 
 
 &#160; 
 
 About – Atlantic Variation (Canadian ASL)  
 
 
 
 &#160; 
 
 About – Ontario Variation (Canadian ASL)  
 
 
 
 Variation in ASL is found throughout the United States and Canada.  
 
 Just as there are accents in speech, there are regional accents in sign. People from the South sign slower than people in the North—even people from northern and southern Indiana have different styles. 
 — Walker, Lou Ann (1987). A Loss for Words: The Story of Deafness in a Family . New York: HarperPerennial. p.&#160;31. ISBN &#160; 0-06-091425-4 . &#160; 
 
 Mutual intelligibility among these ASL varieties is high, and the variation is primarily lexical .  
 There is also a distinct variety of ASL used by the Black deaf community.  
 ASL is used internationally as a lingua franca , and a number of closely related sign languages derived from ASL are used in many different countries.  
 When communicating with hearing English speakers, ASL-speakers often use what is commonly called Pidgin Signed English (PSE) or 'contact signing', a blend of English structure with ASL.  
 Tactile ASL (TASL) is a variety of ASL used throughout the United States by and with the deaf-blind .  
 Stigma  
 ASL faces stigma due to beliefs that spoken language is superior to signed language, as well as the higher perceived status of English and the fact that ASL is sometimes written using English words.  
 The majority of children born to deaf parents are hearing.  
 Writing systems

The ASL phrase "American Sign Language", written in Sutton SignWriting 
 
 
 Although there is no well-established writing system for ASL,  
 The first writing system to gain use among the public was SignWriting , proposed in 1974 by Valerie Sutton .  
 The most widely used transcription system among academics is HamNoSys , developed at the University of Hamburg .  
 
 
 
  
Comparison of ASL writing systems. SignWriting and its handwritten form Si5s are at left, Stokoe notation in the center, SignFont and its simplified derivation ASL-phabet at right. 
 
 
 Several additional candidates for written ASL have appeared over the years, including SignFont , ASL-phabet , and Si5s . 
 For English-speaking audiences, ASL is often glossed using English words. These glosses are typically all-capitalized and are arranged in ASL order. For example, the ASL sentence DOG NOW CHASE&gt;IX=3 CAT, meaning "the dog is chasing the cat", uses NOW to mark ASL progressive aspect and shows ASL verbal inflection for the third person (written with &gt;IX=3). However, glossing is not used to write the language for speakers of ASL.  
 Phonology

 Distinctive features in ASL 
 
 
  
 Phonemic handshape /2/ 
 
 
 
  
 Phonemic handshape /3/ 
 
 
 
 
 Each sign in ASL is composed of a number of distinctive components. A sign may use one hand or both. Each hand assumes a handshape with a particular orientation in a particular location on the body or in the "signing space", and may involve movement .  Changing any one of these may change the meaning of a sign, as illustrated by the ASL signs THINK and DISAPPOINTED: 
 
 
 
 
 THINK  
 
 handshape 
 closed fist with index finger extended 
 
 
 orientation 
 facing signer's body 
 
 
 location 
 tip of finger in contact with forehead 
 
 
 movement 
 unidirectional single contacting movement 
 
 
 
 
 
 DISAPPOINTED  
 
 handshape 
 (as for THINK) 
 
 
 orientation 
 (as for THINK) 
 
 
 location 
 tip of finger in contact with chin 
 
 
 movement 
 (as for THINK) 
 
 
 
 
 
 There are also meaningful non-manual signals in ASL.  
 William Stokoe proposed that these components are analogous to the phonemes of spoken languages.  
 Grammar

 Morphology  
 ASL has a rich system of verbal inflection . This involves both grammatical aspect —how the action of verbs flows in time—and agreement marking.  
 ASL has a productive system of classifiers , which are used to classify objects and their movement in space.  
 Fingerspelling  
 Main article: Fingerspelling 
 
 
 
  
The American manual alphabet. Letters with asterisks are shown from the side (*L left or *R right), rather than as the viewer would see them. 
 
 
 ASL possesses a set of 26 signs known as the American manual alphabet , which can be used to spell out words from the English language.  
 Fingerspelling is a form of borrowing , a linguistic process wherein words from one language are incorporated into another.  
 Syntax  
 The basic word order of ASL is disputed. Most linguists agree that ASL is a subject-verb-object (SVO) language with various phenomena affecting this basic word order.  
 
 FATHER – LOVE – CHILD 
 
"The father loves the child."  
 
 However, other words orders may also occur, as ASL allows the topic of a sentence to be moved to sentence-initial position, a phenomenon known as topicalization .  
 
 CHILD topic , FATHER – LOVE 
 
"The father loves the child."  
 
 Even more word orders can be obtained through the phenomenon of subject copy. In subject copy, the subject is repeated at the end of the sentence, accompanied by head nodding, either for clarification or emphasis:  
 
 FATHER – LOVE – CHILD – FATHER copy 
 
"The father loves the child."  
 
 ASL also allows null subject sentences, where the subject is implied rather than stated explicitly. Subjects can be copied even in a null subject sentence, in which the subject is omitted from its original position, yielding a verb-object-subject (VOS) construction:  
 
 LOVE – CHILD – FATHER copy 
 
"The father loves the child."  
 
 Topicalization, accompanied with a null subject and a subject copy, can produce yet another word order, object-verb-subject (OVS). 
 
 CHILD topic , LOVE – FATHER copy 
 
"The father loves the child."  
 
 These properties of ASL allow it a variety of word orders, leading many to question which is the true, underlying, “basic” order. There are several other proposals that attempt to account for the flexibility of word order in ASL. One proposal is that languages like ASL are best described with a topic–comment structure, where words are ordered by their importance in the sentence rather than by their syntactic properties.  
 Iconicity  
 A common misconception is that signs are iconically self-explanatory, that they are a transparent imitation of what they mean, or even that they are pantomime .  
 In the era of the influential linguist Ferdinand de Saussure , it was assumed that the mapping between form and meaning in language must be completely arbitrary.  
 Research on acquisition of pronouns in ASL has shown that children do not always take advantage of the iconic properties of signs when interpreting their meaning. It has been found that when children acquire the pronoun ‘you’, the iconicity of the point (at the child) is often confused, being treated more like a name.

 Notes  
 
 ^  In particular, Martha's Vineyard Sign Language , Henniker Sign Language , and Sandy River Valley Sign Language were brought to the school by students. These in turn appear to have been influenced by early British Sign Language , and did not involve input from indigenous Native American sign systems. See Padden (2010 :11), Lane, Pillard &amp; French (2000 :17), and Johnson &amp; Schembri (2007 :68). 
 ^  The Abbé Charles-Michel de l'Épée , founder of the Parisian school Institut National de Jeunes Sourds de Paris , was the first to acknowledge that sign language could be used to educate the deaf. An oft-repeated folk tale states that while visiting a parishioner, Épee met two deaf daughters conversing with each other using FSL. The mother explained that her daughters were being educated privately by means of pictures. Épée is said to have been inspired by these deaf children when he established the first educational institution for the deaf. See:

 ^  Whereas deafness was genetically recessive on Martha's Vineyard, it was dominant in Henniker. On the one hand, this dominance likely aided the development of sign language in Henniker since families would be more likely to have the critical mass of deaf people necessary for the propagation of signing. On the other hand, in Martha's Vineyard the deaf were more likely to have more hearing relatives, which may have fostered a sense of shared identity that lead to more inter-group communication than in Henniker. See Lane, Pillard &amp; French (2000 :39). 
 ^  Although some surveys of smaller scope measure ASL use, such as the California Department of Education recording ASL use in the home when children begin school, ASL use in the general American population has not been directly measured. See Mitchell et al. (2006 :1). 
 ^  Stokoe himself termed these cheremes , but other linguists have referred to them as phonemes. See Bahan (1996 :11).
